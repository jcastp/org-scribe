* Overview

=emacs-writing= is a comprehensive, batteries-included toolkit for novelists, short story writers, and creative writers working in Emacs Org-mode. It provides everything you need from project creation to final export: templates, writing environments, word counting, progress tracking, and powerful search capabilities.

*Version 0.2.0* merges the functionality of =emacs-writing-template=, providing a complete integrated writing environment in a single package.

* Features

* Quick Start

** Create Your First Novel Project

1. Install the package and dependencies
2. Run =M-x writing-create-project= (or =F8 F8 P= if using hydra)
3. Choose a directory and enter your novel title
4. Start writing in the generated =novel.org= file!

** Working in an Existing Project

1. Open an org-mode file in your project
2. Press =<f8> <f8>= to open the hydra menu
3. Try a writing mode: press =w= for distraction-free mode
4. Use =n= to count words in the current section
5. Insert scenes with =S= or chapters with =C=

* Usage

** Project Creation

*** Create a New Novel Project

=M-x writing-create-project= or press =F8 F8 P= in hydra

This creates a complete project structure:

#+begin_example
MyNovel/
├── README.org              # Project overview and status
├── novel.org              # Main manuscript with progress tracking
├── revision.org           # Revision tracking
├── writing-journal.org    # Reflective writing journal
├── plan/                  # Planning documents
│   ├── characters.org
│   ├── locations.org
│   ├── plot.org
│   ├── timeline.org
│   └── objects.org
└── notes/                 # Research and notes
    ├── notes.org
    └── research.org
#+end_example

The project includes:
- Pre-configured word count tracking
- Scene and chapter templates
- Progress tracking tables
- Export configurations for LaTeX, ODT, HTML, EPUB
- Git repository initialization

*** Insert Scene or Chapter

While working in your manuscript:

- =M-x writing-insert-scene= or =F8 F8 S=: Insert a scene with metadata properties (PoV, Characters, Plot, Location, etc.)
- =M-x writing-insert-chapter= or =F8 F8 C=: Insert a chapter heading with word count property

*** Quick Project File Access

=M-x writing-open-project-file= or =F8 F8 O=

Opens project files with completion (novel.org, plan/characters.org, notes/notes.org, etc.)

*** Customize Templates

=M-x writing-edit-templates=

Opens the template directory for editing. Customize templates to match your workflow!

** Writing Modes

*** Distraction-Free Mode (=my-writing-env-mode=)

Press =F8 F8 w= or use the hydra menu.

Changes:
- Switches to writing theme
- Changes font to writing preset
- Activates writeroom-mode
- Shows line numbers

*** Focus Mode (=my-writing-env-mode-focus=)

Press =F8 F8 f= or use the hydra menu.

Like distraction-free mode, but also narrows to the current org section.

*** Project Navigation Mode (=project-writing-mode=)

Opens treemacs (file tree) and imenu-list (document outline) for easy navigation.

*** Editing Mode (=writing/editing-mode=)

Three-pane layout:
- Left: Document outline (imenu-list)
- Center: Main document
- Right: Notes file (org-remark annotations)

** Word Counting

*** Count Words in Selection

=M-x org-context-count-words= or press =F8 F8 n= in hydra

*** Add Word Count Properties

=M-x writing/ews-org-count-words= or press =F8 F8 m= in hydra

Adds a =WORDCOUNT= property to each heading.

*** Generate Word Count Table

Add this to your org file:

#+begin_example
#+BEGIN: org-generate-wordcount-table
#+END:
#+end_example

Update with =C-c C-c= on the #+BEGIN line.

** Search Functions

All search functions are available via the hydra menu (=F8 F8=):

- =u=: Find scenes by POV character
- =i=: Find scenes with character
- =o=: Find scenes by plot keyword
- =y=: Find scenes by location
- =a=: Find all TODO items in project

These searches use org properties. Example:

#+begin_example
* Chapter 1
:PROPERTIES:
:POV: Alice
:Characters: Alice, Bob, Carol
:location: Coffee Shop
:plot: First meeting
:END:
#+end_example

** Dictionary Tools

*** Spanish RAE Dictionary

=M-x writing/rae-api-lookup= or press =F8 F8 r= in hydra

Looks up Spanish words in the Real Academia Española dictionary.

*** Synonyms

=M-x writing/sinonimo= or press =F8 F8 s= in hydra

Opens WordReference Spanish synonyms in a side window.

** Capture Notes

=M-x writing/capture-to-file= or press =C-c W=

Automatically finds the right notes file in your project structure.

** Export with Scene Breaks

Add this macro to your org file:

#+begin_example
#+MACRO: scene-break SCENE-BREAK
#+end_example

Use ={{{scene-break}}}= where you want scene breaks.

When exporting, scene breaks will be replaced with appropriate separators for each backend (HTML, LaTeX, Markdown, etc.).

* Project Structure

=emacs-writing= creates and works with structured novel projects:

#+begin_example
project-root/
├── .writing-project       # Project marker file
├── README.org            # Project overview
├── novel.org             # Main manuscript with progress tracking (or novela.org for Spanish)

** Version 0.2.0 Changes

Version 0.2.0 merges [[https://codeberg.org/jcastp/emacs-writing-template][emacs-writing-template]] into this package, providing:

- Project creation with customizable templates

   - =writing-project-create-novel-project= → =writing-create-project=
   - =writing-project-insert-scene= → =writing-insert-scene=
   - =writing-project-insert-chapter= → =writing-insert-chapter=
   - =writing-project-open-novel-file= → =writing-open-project-file=
