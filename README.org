4. Use =n= to count words in the current section
5. Insert scenes with =S= or chapters with =C=

* Usage

** Project Creation

*** Create a New Novel Project

=M-x writing-create-project= or press =F8 F8 P= in hydra

This creates a complete project structure:

#+begin_example
MyNovel/
├── README.org              # Project overview and status
├── novel.org              # Main manuscript with progress tracking
├── revision.org           # Revision tracking
├── writing-journal.org    # Reflective writing journal
├── plan/                  # Planning documents
│   ├── characters.org
│   ├── locations.org
│   ├── plot.org
│   ├── timeline.org
│   └── objects.org
└── notes/                 # Research and notes
    ├── notes.org
    └── research.org
#+end_example

The project includes:
- Pre-configured word count tracking
- Scene and chapter templates
- Progress tracking tables
- Export configurations for LaTeX, ODT, HTML, EPUB
- Git repository initialization

*** Insert Scene or Chapter

While working in your manuscript:

- =M-x writing-insert-scene= or =F8 F8 S=: Insert a scene with metadata properties (PoV, Characters, Plot, Location, etc.)
- =M-x writing-insert-chapter= or =F8 F8 C=: Insert a chapter heading with word count property

*** Quick Project File Access

=M-x writing-open-project-file= or =F8 F8 O=

Opens project files with completion (novel.org, plan/characters.org, notes/notes.org, etc.)

*** Customize Templates

=M-x writing-edit-templates=

Opens the template directory for editing. Customize templates to match your workflow!

** Writing Modes

*** Distraction-Free Mode (=my-writing-env-mode=)

Press =F8 F8 w= or use the hydra menu.

Changes:
- Switches to writing theme
- Changes font to writing preset
- Activates writeroom-mode
- Shows line numbers

*** Focus Mode (=my-writing-env-mode-focus=)

Press =F8 F8 f= or use the hydra menu.

Like distraction-free mode, but also narrows to the current org section.

*** Project Navigation Mode (=project-writing-mode=)

Opens treemacs (file tree) and imenu-list (document outline) for easy navigation.

*** Editing Mode (=writing/editing-mode=)

Three-pane layout:
- Left: Document outline (imenu-list)
- Center: Main document
- Right: Notes file (org-remark annotations)

** Word Counting

*** Count Words in Selection

=M-x org-context-count-words= or press =F8 F8 n= in hydra

*** Add Word Count Properties

=M-x writing/ews-org-count-words= or press =F8 F8 m= in hydra

Adds a =WORDCOUNT= property to each heading.

*** Generate Word Count Table with Progress

Add this to your org file:

#+begin_example
#+BEGIN: org-generate-wordcount-table
#+END:
#+end_example

Update with =C-c C-c= on the #+BEGIN line.

This generates a comprehensive table showing:
- Hierarchical heading structure (Acts, Chapters, Scenes)
- Wordcount (from =WORDCOUNT= property)
- Objective (from =WORD-OBJECTIVE= property, when set)
- Progress (auto-calculated percentage)

**Example output:**

#+begin_example
| Heading                     | Wordcount | Objective | Progress |
|-----------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------|
| - Act I                     |       711 |      5000 |      14% |
| -- Chapter 1                |       447 |      1500 |      30% |
| --- Scene 1 - The Alarm     |       167 |       500 |      33% |
| --- Scene 2 - Coffee Shop   |       280 |       500 |      56% |
#+end_example

*** Set Word Objectives for Progress Tracking

Add the =WORD-OBJECTIVE= property to your Acts, Chapters, or Scenes to enable automatic progress calculation:

#+begin_example
* Act I :ignore:
:PROPERTIES:
:WORDCOUNT: 711
:WORD-OBJECTIVE: 5000
:END:
#+end_example

When you update the word count table (with =C-c C-c= on the #+BEGIN line), progress percentages will be automatically calculated for any section that has a =WORD-OBJECTIVE= property.

** Character Linking

*** Overview

Link character names in scene properties directly to their full profiles in =plan/characters.org=. Click on character names to jump to detailed character information!

*** Quick Start

For existing projects:
1. =M-x writing/setup-character-links= or press =F8 F8 L s=
2. Adds unique IDs to all characters
3. Optionally converts existing scenes to use links

For new characters:
- Characters created with =writing/capture-character= (F8 F8 h) automatically get IDs
- No manual setup needed!

*** Setting Scene Characters

*Set PoV Character* (=F8 F8 L p=):
1. Position on scene heading
2. Press =F8 F8 L p=
3. Select character from menu
4. PoV property updated with ID link

*Set Scene Characters* (=F8 F8 L c=):
1. Position on scene heading
2. Press =F8 F8 L c=
3. Select characters one by one
4. Press RET to finish
5. Characters property updated with ID links

*** Navigation

*Jump to PoV Character* (=F8 F8 L j=):
- Instantly jump from scene to PoV character's full profile
- Press =C-c &= to return to scene

*Click Any Character Link*:
- Position cursor on character name in properties
- Press =C-c C-o= (or click with mouse)
- Jumps to character profile

*** How It Works

Scene properties change from plain text to ID links:

Before:
#+begin_example
:PoV: Alex
:Characters: Alex, Sam
#+end_example

After:
#+begin_example
:PoV: [[id:char-alex-rivera-001][Alex]]
:Characters: [[id:char-alex-rivera-001][Alex]], [[id:char-sam-chen-002][Sam]]
#+end_example

Benefits:
- Click to navigate to character profiles
- Links survive character renames
- Searches still work (automatic extraction)
- Quick reference while writing

*** Character Linking Hydra Menu

Press =F8 F8 L= to access:
- =p= - Set PoV character
- =c= - Set scene characters
- =j= - Jump to PoV character
- =l= - Link current scene
- =L= - Link all scenes
- =i= - Add IDs to characters
- =s= - Setup linking system

See [[file:CHARACTER-LINKING.org][Character Linking Guide]] for complete documentation.

** Plot Thread Linking and Analysis

*** Overview

Track your main plot and subplots across your novel using ID-based links. The plot thread system provides visualization, health monitoring, and gap detection to ensure plot threads are properly developed throughout your story.

*** Quick Start

For existing projects:
1. =M-x writing/setup-plot-thread-links= or press =F8 F8 T s=
2. Adds unique IDs to all plot threads in =plan/plot.org=
3. Optionally converts existing scenes to use links

For new plot threads:
- Plot threads created with =writing/capture-plot-thread= automatically get IDs
- No manual setup needed!

*** Setting Scene Plot Threads

*Set Scene Plot Threads* (=F8 F8 T p=):
1. Position on scene heading
2. Press =F8 F8 T p=
3. Select plot threads one by one (main plot, subplots)
4. Press RET to finish
5. Plot property updated with ID links

*Jump to Plot Thread* (=F8 F8 T j=):
- Jump from scene to plot thread definition
- Press =C-c &= to return to scene

*** Plot Thread Analysis

**** Timeline Visualization

Generate a timeline table showing which plot threads appear in which scenes:

1. Add to your manuscript or a separate analysis file:
   #+begin_example
   #+BEGIN: plot-thread-timeline
   #+END:
   #+end_example

2. Press =C-c C-c= on the #+BEGIN line to generate/update

**Example output:**
#+begin_example
| Scene              | Chapter   | Main Plot | Romance Subplot | Mystery Subplot |
|--------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------------+-----------------|
| Scene 1 - Opening  | Chapter 1 | ●         |                 | ●               |
| Scene 2 - Meeting  | Chapter 1 | ●         | ●               |                 |
| Scene 3 - Discovery| Chapter 2 | ●         |                 | ●               |
#+end_example

The ● symbol shows where each plot thread appears, making it easy to spot:
- Threads that appear too frequently (overwhelming)
- Threads with large gaps (forgotten subplots)
- Threads that only appear once (abandoned story lines)

**** Health Report

Generate a comprehensive health report for all plot threads:

=M-x writing/plot-thread-report= or press =F8 F8 T r=

This generates a buffer showing:
- Total plot threads and scenes
- Per-thread analysis:
  - Scene count and coverage percentage
  - First and last appearance
  - Warnings for potential issues

**Warning indicators:**
- ⚠️ *Low coverage* (<30% of scenes) - thread may be underdeveloped
- ⚠️ *Large gap* (>5 consecutive scenes) - thread may be forgotten
- ⚠️ *Single scene* - thread appears only once, might need expansion

**Example report:**
#+begin_example
* Summary
- Total plot threads: 3
- Total scenes: 12
- Scenes with plot threads: 12

* Thread Details

** ✓ Main Plot
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: plot-main-001
:END:

- Scenes: 12 of 12 (100.0%)
- First appearance: Scene 1 - Opening (Chapter: Chapter 1)
- Last appearance: Scene 12 - Finale (Chapter: Chapter 4)

** ⚠️ Romance Subplot
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: plot-romance-002
:END:

- Scenes: 3 of 12 (25.0%)
- First appearance: Scene 2 (Chapter: Chapter 1)
- Last appearance: Scene 10 (Chapter: Chapter 3)

*Warnings:*
- ⚠️ Low coverage (25.0%)
- ⚠️ Gap of 6 scenes
#+end_example

**** Quick Statistics

Get quick statistics in the minibuffer:

=M-x writing/plot-thread-stats= or press =F8 F8 T S=

Shows:
- Total threads
- Total scenes with plot thread tracking
- Average thread coverage
- Threads with warnings

*** How It Works

Scene properties change from plain text to ID links:

Before:
#+begin_example
:Plot: Main Plot, Romance
#+end_example

After:
#+begin_example
:Plot: [[id:plot-main-001][Main Plot]], [[id:plot-romance-002][Romance]]
#+end_example

Benefits:
- Click to navigate to plot thread details in =plan/plot.org=
- Links survive plot thread renames
- Timeline and health reports automatically track all scenes
- Identify plot issues before they become problems

*** Plot Thread Linking Hydra Menu

Press =F8 F8 T= to access:
- =p= - Set scene plot threads
- =j= - Jump to plot thread
- =l= - Link current scene
- =L= - Link all scenes
- =i= - Add IDs to threads
- =s= - Setup linking system
- =t= - Timeline table (shows how to insert)
- =r= - Health report
- =S= - Statistics

*** Best Practices

1. *Use Descriptive Names*: "Main Plot: Hero's Journey" instead of just "A-plot"
2. *Review Health Reports Regularly*: Check for gaps and low coverage during revisions
3. *Balance Plot Threads*: Aim for main plot in 80-100% of scenes, subplots in 30-60%
4. *Track Timeline*: Update timeline table periodically to visualize distribution
5. *Fix Gaps Early*: If a subplot has a gap >5 scenes, consider adding a scene or removing the thread

** Character Timeline

*** Overview

Track character appearances across your novel using a visual timeline. See at a glance which characters appear in which scenes, who has the PoV, and identify coverage gaps.

*** Quick Start

Character timeline uses the existing character properties you're already setting:

1. Tag scenes with character information (using ID links or plain text):
   #+begin_example
   :PoV: [[id:char-alice-001][Alice]]
   :Characters: [[id:char-alice-001][Alice]], [[id:char-bob-002][Bob]]
   #+end_example

2. Add timeline block to your =novel.org= (already in template):
   #+begin_example
   #+BEGIN: character-timeline
   #+END:
   #+end_example

3. Press =C-c C-c= on the #+BEGIN line to generate/update

*** Reading the Timeline

**Symbols**:
- ◆ = Character is the Point of View character (implies presence)
- ● = Character is present in the scene (not PoV)
- (blank) = Character is not present

**Example**:
#+begin_example
| Scene              | Chapter   | Alice | Bob | Charlie |
|--------------------+-----------+-------+-----+---------|
| Scene 1 - Opening  | Chapter 1 | ◆     | ●   |         |
| Scene 2 - Meeting  | Chapter 1 | ●     |     | ●       |
| Scene 3 - Conflict | Chapter 2 | ◆     | ●   | ●       |
#+end_example

**Interpretation**:
- Alice: PoV in scenes 1 and 3, present (not PoV) in scene 2
- Bob: Present in scenes 1 and 3, absent from scene 2
- Charlie: Appears in scenes 2 and 3, absent from scene 1

*** Use Cases

1. **Character Coverage**: "Is my protagonist appearing enough?"
   - Check main character appears in 80-100% of scenes
   - Identify extended absences

2. **PoV Balance** (Multi-POV Novels): "Am I favoring one viewpoint too much?"
   - Scan ◆ symbols across characters
   - Ensure balanced distribution
   - Verify alternating pattern (if desired)

3. **Gap Detection**: "Did I forget about this character?"
   - Spot large gaps (>10 scenes without appearance)
   - Identify forgotten supporting characters
   - Plan reintroduction scenes

4. **Character Arc Tracking**: "Is the character development well-distributed?"
   - See all scenes featuring specific character
   - Verify arc scenes span appropriate chapters
   - Check character appears in key moments

5. **Relationship Tracking**: "When do these characters interact?"
   - Find rows where both characters have symbols
   - Frequency of joint appearances
   - Last interaction

*** How It Works

The timeline automatically:
- Extracts character names from `:PoV:` and `:Characters:` properties
- Handles both plain text and ID links (extracts display text)
- Shows only characters who appear in at least one scene
- Sorts characters alphabetically for easy location
- Distinguishes PoV from other appearances

If a character is PoV and also in Characters property, only ◆ is shown (PoV implies presence).

*** Best Practices

1. **Consistent Tagging**: Always set both PoV and Characters properties for complete tracking

2. **Main vs. Supporting**:
   - Main characters: Should appear in 60-100% of scenes
   - Supporting characters: 20-50% coverage is normal
   - Minor characters: <20% is fine

3. **Update Regularly**:
   - After writing each chapter
   - Before planning next chapter (identify gaps)
   - During revision (overall balance check)

4. **PoV Distribution** (Multi-POV):
   - Aim for minimum scenes per PoV character per act
   - Check PoV distribution is intentional
   - Avoid accidental PoV dominance

5. **Balance with Plot Timeline**:
   - Character timeline shows *who*
   - Plot timeline shows *what*
   - Use both for complete picture

*** Example Workflow

**Scenario**: Revising Act II, checking supporting character "Eve"

1. Open =novel.org= in Progress Tracking section
2. Find Character Timeline table
3. Press =C-c C-c= to update
4. Scan Eve column:
   #+begin_example
   | Scene 5  | Ch 3 |   |   | ● |   |
   | Scene 6  | Ch 3 |   |   |   |   |  ← Gap starts
   | Scene 7  | Ch 4 |   |   |   |   |
   | Scene 8  | Ch 4 |   |   | ● |   |  ← Gap ends (3 scenes)
   #+end_example
5. Notice: Eve has a 3-scene gap (scenes 6-7)
6. Decision: Add Eve to Scene 7 for continuity
7. Update Scene 7 properties:
   #+begin_example
   :Characters: Alice, Bob, Eve
   #+end_example
8. Re-generate timeline to verify

**Result**: Eve's gap reduced, better presence continuity

** Search Functions

All search functions are available via the hydra menu (=F8 F8=):

- =u=: Find scenes by POV character
- =i=: Find scenes with character
- =o=: Find scenes by plot keyword
- =y=: Find scenes by location
- =a=: Find all TODO items in project

These searches use org properties and work with both plain text and ID links:

#+begin_example
* Chapter 1
:PROPERTIES:
:PoV: [[id:char-alice-001][Alice]]
:Characters: [[id:char-alice-001][Alice]], [[id:char-bob-002][Bob]]
:Location: Coffee Shop
:Plot: First meeting
:END:
#+end_example

Searching for "Alice" finds this scene even with ID links!

** Dictionary Tools

*** Spanish RAE Dictionary

=M-x writing/rae-api-lookup= or press =F8 F8 r= in hydra

Looks up Spanish words in the Real Academia Española dictionary.

*** Synonyms

=M-x writing/sinonimo= or press =F8 F8 s= in hydra

Opens WordReference Spanish synonyms in a side window.

** Capture Notes

=M-x writing/capture-to-file= or press =C-c W=

Automatically finds the right notes file in your project structure.

** Export with Scene Breaks

Add this macro to your org file:

#+begin_example
#+MACRO: scene-break SCENE-BREAK
#+end_example

Use ={{{scene-break}}}= where you want scene breaks.

When exporting, scene breaks will be replaced with appropriate separators for each backend (HTML, LaTeX, Markdown, etc.).

* Project Structure

=emacs-writing= creates and works with structured novel projects:

#+begin_example
project-root/
├── .writing-project       # Project marker file

** Version 0.2.1 Changes (NEW)

Version 0.2.1 introduces comprehensive *ID-Based Linking Systems* for characters, locations, and plot threads:

*** Character Linking
- *ID-Based Character Links*: Link scene properties to character profiles
- *Automatic ID Creation*: New characters automatically get unique IDs
- *Menu-Based Selection*: Select characters from completion menus
- *Click Navigation*: Click character names to jump to full profiles
- *Smart Searches*: Search functions work with both plain text and ID links
- *Batch Operations*: Convert entire projects at once
- *Backward Compatible*: Works with existing plain text properties

See [[file:CHARACTER-LINKING.org][Character Linking Guide]] for complete documentation and [[file:examples/demo-novel/CHARACTER-LINKING-DEMO.org][Interactive Demo]].

*** Location Linking
- *ID-Based Location Links*: Link scenes to detailed location/setting descriptions
- *Same Pattern*: Works identically to character linking
- *Jump Navigation*: Click location names to jump to world-building details
- *Menu Selection*: Choose locations from completion menus

*** Plot Thread Linking and Analysis
- *ID-Based Plot Links*: Track main plot and subplots across your novel
- *Timeline Visualization*: Dynamic block showing plot distribution across scenes
- *Health Reports*: Automated analysis identifying plot issues:
  - Low coverage threads (<30% of scenes)
  - Large gaps (>5 consecutive scenes without thread)
  - Single-scene threads (potentially abandoned)
- *Quick Statistics*: Overview of thread coverage and warnings
- *Click Navigation*: Jump from scene to plot thread details
- *Gap Detection*: Identify forgotten subplots before they become problems

*** Column View Enhancement
- *Clean Display*: Automatically strips ID link syntax in org-mode column view
- *Transparent*: Shows "Alex" instead of "[[id:abc123][Alex]]"
- *Universal*: Works for all linked properties (PoV, Characters, Plot, Location)
- *Preserves Links*: Navigation still works with =C-c C-o=
- *Optional*: Can be disabled via customization

** Version 0.2.0 Changes

Version 0.2.0 merges [[https://codeberg.org/jcastp/emacs-writing-template][emacs-writing-template]] into this package, providing:

- Project creation with customizable templates
- Scene and chapter insertion functions
- Quick project file navigation
- Integrated git initialization
- Bilingual template support (English/Spanish)

All =writing-project-*= functions from the old package are available as backward-compatible aliases.

*** Migration from emacs-writing-template

If you were using =emacs-writing-template= separately:

1. Remove =emacs-writing-template= from your config
2. Update to =emacs-writing= 0.2.0+
3. Old function names still work (with deprecation warnings):
   - =writing-project-create-novel-project= → =writing-create-project=
   - =writing-project-insert-scene= → =writing-insert-scene=
   - =writing-project-insert-chapter= → =writing-insert-chapter=
   - =writing-project-open-novel-file= → =writing-open-project-file=

* Acknowledgments

This package was developed for bilingual (English/Spanish) creative writing workflows. It integrates many excellent Emacs packages to provide a comprehensive writing environment.
