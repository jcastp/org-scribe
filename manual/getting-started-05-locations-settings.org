#+TITLE: Lesson 5: Locations and Settings
#+AUTHOR: Javier Castilla
#+DATE: 2025-11-16
#+STARTUP: overview

* Welcome to Lesson 5!

In this lesson, you'll learn how to create and manage location profiles for your story's settings. Just like characters, locations can be captured, linked to scenes, and searched throughout your manuscript.

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Create detailed location profiles using the capture template
- Understand all location properties and when to use them
- Link locations to scenes using ID-based links
- Search for all scenes set in a specific location
- Track setting variety across your story
- Generate location timelines showing when and how locations are used

*Estimated time*: 15-20 minutes

* Prerequisites

Before starting this lesson, you should have completed:
- [[file:getting-started-01-creating-projects.org][Lesson 1: Creating Your First Project]]
- [[file:getting-started-02-first-scene.org][Lesson 2: Writing Your First Scene]]
- [[file:getting-started-04-capturing-characters.org][Lesson 4: Capturing Characters]] (recommended - same linking concepts)

You should understand:
- How to use the Hydra menu (F8 F8)
- Basic Org-mode properties
- ID-based linking (from character lesson)
- Scene properties

* Why Capture Locations?

**Quick answer**: Locations ground your story in physical space and help maintain consistency.

** The Problem Without Location Tracking

When writing without location tracking, you might:
- Describe a coffee shop as "small and cozy" in Chapter 1, then "spacious with high ceilings" in Chapter 5
- Forget which scenes happen in the protagonist's apartment
- Realize you've set 15 consecutive scenes in the same location (boring!)
- Struggle to remember what details you've revealed about a location
- Have inconsistent geography (the park that's sometimes downtown, sometimes uptown)

** The Solution: Location Profiles

Location profiles help you:
1. **Maintain Consistency**: Reference your description instead of contradicting yourself
2. **Track Usage**: See how often you use each setting
3. **Balance Variety**: Ensure you're not overusing certain locations
4. **Quick Reference**: Remember key details when writing a scene
5. **World-Building**: Build a coherent fictional geography
6. **Search**: Find all scenes in a specific location instantly

* Understanding Location Types

Before capturing locations, understand the different types:

** Primary Locations

Settings that appear frequently throughout your story.

*Examples*:
- Protagonist's home or apartment
- Main workplace
- School or university
- Central gathering place (coffee shop, park, etc.)

*When to create*: Before or during early drafting.

** Secondary Locations

Settings that appear multiple times but less frequently.

*Examples*:
- Friend's apartment
- Favorite restaurant
- Subway station
- Library

*When to create*: As you write scenes in these locations.

** Minor Locations

Settings that appear once or twice but are important to remember.

*Examples*:
- Hotel lobby for a key conversation
- Rooftop where a crucial event happens
- Specific street corner

*When to create*: When consistency matters even for brief appearances.

** Atmospheric Locations

Settings that define your story's mood or world.

*Examples*:
- The haunted mansion (horror)
- The starship bridge (sci-fi)
- The medieval castle (fantasy)
- The corporate office (contemporary drama)

*When to create*: Early in planning - these shape your story's feel.

* The Location Capture Template

Let's explore what's in the location capture template.

** Accessing the Template

Press: ~F8 F8 l~ (that's F8 twice, then lowercase L for "location")

Or use: ~M-x org-scribe/capture-location~

** Template Structure

The template has 6 main sections:

1. **Header with Properties** - Type, importance, first appearance
2. **Physical Description** - What it looks like, sensory details
3. **Atmosphere & Mood** - How it feels
4. **Significance** - Why it matters to the story
5. **Connections** - Related locations, characters who frequent it
6. **Notes** - Writer notes and continuity details

Let's examine each section in detail.

* Section 1: Properties

When you capture a location, you'll see these properties:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: location-unique-id-here
:Type:
:Importance:
:First-appearance:
:Setting:
:Accessibility:
:Owner:
:Atmosphere:
:END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

** :ID: (Automatic)

A unique identifier for this location, created automatically.

*Example*: ~loc-coffee-shop-20251116-001~

*Purpose*: Enables clickable links from scenes to location profiles.

*You don't set this* - it's automatic!

** :Type:

The category of location.

*Common values*:
- Residence (home, apartment)
- Business (store, office, restaurant)
- Public (park, library, street)
- Institution (school, hospital, government)
- Transportation (car, train, airport)
- Natural (forest, beach, mountain)
- Other (anything else)

*Example*: ~Business~

*Tip*: Use broad categories. You'll add specifics in the description.

** :Importance:

How central this location is to your story.

*Values*:
- Primary - Appears frequently, major story significance
- Secondary - Appears multiple times, moderate importance
- Minor - One or two appearances, but memorable

*Example*: ~Primary~

*Tip*: If unsure, start with Secondary. You can upgrade later.

** :First-appearance:

When readers first see this location.

*Format*: ~Chapter X, Scene Y~ or ~Scene title~

*Examples*:
- ~Chapter 1, Scene 2~
- ~Scene 3 - The Coffee Shop Encounter~
- ~Opening scene~

*Tip*: Fill this when you link the location to its first scene.

** :Setting:

Broader context - where is this location?

*Examples*:
- ~Downtown Manhattan~
- ~Rural Ohio~
- ~Mars Colony Alpha~
- ~Victorian London~
- ~The protagonist's neighborhood~

*Purpose*: Shows geographic relationships between locations.

** :Accessibility:

Who can access this location and when?

*Examples*:
- ~Public, 24 hours~
- ~Private residence~
- ~Members only~
- ~Business hours (9-5)~
- ~Invitation required~

*Tip*: This prevents plot holes (character shows up when location is closed).

** :Owner:

Who owns, manages, or controls this location?

*Examples*:
- ~Sarah Martinez~ (character link)
- ~City Parks Department~
- ~Abandoned~
- ~Corporation XYZ~

*Tip*: You can link to character profiles here if the owner is a character.

** :Atmosphere:

The overall feeling or mood.

*Examples*:
- ~Cozy, intimate~
- ~Sterile, clinical~
- ~Chaotic, energetic~
- ~Peaceful, contemplative~
- ~Threatening, oppressive~

*Tip*: Use sensory language that evokes feeling.

* Section 2: Physical Description

This is the heart of your location profile.

** What to Include

*** Visual Details
- Size and layout
- Colors and lighting
- Furniture and objects
- Architectural features
- View from windows

*** Sensory Details
- Sounds (traffic, music, silence)
- Smells (coffee, flowers, exhaust)
- Textures (smooth tables, rough brick)
- Temperature (warm, drafty, humid)

*** Time-Specific Details
- How it changes throughout the day
- Seasonal variations
- Weather effects

** Example: Coffee Shop

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Physical Description

Downtown Coffee Collective is a narrow, deep space with exposed brick walls
and reclaimed wood floors. Mismatched vintage chairs cluster around small
round tables. The back wall is floor-to-ceiling bookshelves (customers leave
books, take books). Large front windows flood the space with morning light
but make it dim in the afternoon.

The espresso machine dominates the counter - chrome and copper, always
hissing. Smells: fresh coffee beans, cinnamon from pastries, sometimes rain
from wet coats. Sound: indie music plays low, ceramic mugs clink, the door
chime jingles.

Busiest 7-9 AM (laptop crowd) and 3-5 PM (students). Empty 10 AM-2 PM.
Temperature: too warm in summer (no AC), perfect in fall.
#+END_EXAMPLE

** How Much Detail?

*** Minimum (5 minutes):
- Size and basic layout
- Key visual features
- Dominant sensory impression

*** Standard (15 minutes):
- Above plus specific furniture/objects
- Multiple senses (sight, sound, smell)
- Lighting and atmosphere

*** Comprehensive (30 minutes):
- Above plus time variations
- Weather and seasonal changes
- Historical details or backstory

*Recommendation*: Start with standard, expand when writing scenes there.

* Section 3: Atmosphere & Mood

How does this location *feel*?

** Why This Matters

The same physical space can have different atmospheres:
- An empty church: reverent, peaceful, echoing
- A crowded church during service: communal, joyful, energetic

Atmosphere affects how characters behave and how readers feel.

** What to Include

- Emotional tone (welcoming, hostile, neutral, charged)
- Energy level (frenetic, calm, tense, sleepy)
- How it affects characters (relaxes them, puts them on edge, inspires them)
- Cultural or social implications (formal, casual, exclusive, open)

** Example: Coffee Shop

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Atmosphere & Mood

Warm and welcoming but slightly bohemian - not for everyone. Regulars treat
it like a second living room. Laptop workers claim tables for hours. The
staff knows names and orders.

There's an unspoken code: headphones mean don't talk to me, but book reading
means you're open to chat. First-timers stand awkwardly at the counter,
unsure of the ordering system.

For Alex, this place means safety and routine. For corporate types, it's
uncomfortably informal.
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Section 4: Significance

Why does this location matter to your story?

** Story Function

- Plot significance (where key events happen)
- Character significance (represents something to a character)
- Thematic significance (symbolizes story themes)
- Structural significance (recurring setting that frames story)

** Example: Coffee Shop

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Significance

This is Alex's anchor point - the story begins here and returns here
repeatedly. It represents stability and normalcy, so when things go wrong
elsewhere, Alex retreats here.

Plot-wise:
- Opening scene establishes daily routine
- First meeting with Sam happens here (Chapter 1)
- Major argument with Jordan (Chapter 8)
- Final reconciliation scene (Chapter 15)

Thematically: represents the "ordinary world" that's threatened by the
main conflict.
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Section 5: Connections

How does this location relate to others?

** Geographic Connections

- Adjacent locations
- Same neighborhood or district
- Travel time between locations

** Social Connections

- Characters who frequent this location
- Events that happen here
- Other locations with similar atmosphere

** Example: Coffee Shop

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Connections

*** Geographic
- 2 blocks from Alex's apartment (5-minute walk)
- Across from Washington Park
- Same block as Sam's bookstore

*** Frequent Visitors
- Alex (daily morning regular)
- Sam (occasional, afternoon)
- Jordan (shows up twice, feels out of place)

*** Similar Atmosphere
- The bookstore (also cozy, browsing-friendly)
- Washington Park (peaceful, contemplative)

*** Contrasting Locations
- Alex's office (sterile, corporate) - opposite feeling
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Section 6: Notes

Writer notes for continuity and reminders.

** What to Include

- Continuity details (what's been revealed to readers)
- Future plans (events to happen here)
- Research needed
- Real-world inspiration
- Changes over time (if location evolves)

** Example: Coffee Shop

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Notes

*** Revealed to Reader
- [Chapter 1] Front windows, espresso machine, brick walls
- [Chapter 3] Bookshelf wall
- [Chapter 5] Alex's usual table (back left corner)
- [Chapter 8] Bathroom location (down narrow hallway)

*** To Reveal Later
- Owner's name (mention in Chapter 10)
- Back alley entrance (needed for Chapter 12 escape scene)

*** Research
- Check typical coffee shop profit margins for owner's dialogue

*** Inspiration
Based on my local spot "Common Grounds" - but fictional version is narrower.

*** Evolution
In Chapter 14, they renovate: new paint, but keep same furniture (shows
gentrification theme).

* Capturing a Location: Step-by-Step

Let's create a location profile together.

** Step 1: Invoke Capture

Press: ~F8 F8 l~

You'll see: ~Capture location name:~

** Step 2: Enter Location Name

Type: ~Downtown Coffee Collective~

Press: ~Enter~

The capture template opens in a new buffer.

** Step 3: Fill Properties

The template has property prompts:

1. ~Type:~ → Type: ~Business~
2. ~Importance:~ → Type: ~Primary~
3. ~First-appearance:~ → Leave blank for now (fill when linking to scene)
4. ~Setting:~ → Type: ~Downtown~
5. ~Accessibility:~ → Type: ~Public, 6 AM - 8 PM~
6. ~Owner:~ → Type: ~Independent~
7. ~Atmosphere:~ → Type: ~Cozy, bohemian~

Press ~Tab~ to move between prompts (or click with mouse).

** Step 4: Fill Description Sections

Navigate to each section and write:
- Physical Description: 1-2 paragraphs
- Atmosphere & Mood: 1 paragraph
- Significance: 1 paragraph
- Connections: List format
- Notes: As needed

** Step 5: Finalize Capture

When done, press: ~C-c C-c~

This saves the location profile to:
- **Novel project**: ~objects/locations.org~
- **Short story project**: ~notes.org~ (under "Setting → Locations")

** Step 6: Verify It Saved

Open your locations file and find your new location entry. It should be a level-1 heading with an ID.

* Linking Locations to Scenes

Once you have location profiles, link them to scenes.

** Method 1: Set Location via Menu (Recommended)

1. Open your manuscript (novel.org or story.org)
2. Navigate to a scene heading
3. Press: ~F8 F8 L L~ (capital L twice - Location menu, then Link)

Or use: ~M-x org-scribe/set-scene-location~

4. You'll see a menu of all locations
5. Select one: Press ~Enter~
6. The scene's ~:Location:~ property is updated with an ID link

** Method 2: Manual Linking

If you prefer typing:

1. Navigate to scene properties
2. Find or add: ~:Location:~
3. Type: ~[[id:location-id-here][Location Name]]~

This requires knowing the location's ID. The menu method is easier!

** Example

Before:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** Scene 1 - Morning Routine
:PROPERTIES:
:PoV: [[id:char-alex-001][Alex]]
:Location: coffee shop
:END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

After (with menu):
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** Scene 1 - Morning Routine
:PROPERTIES:
:PoV: [[id:char-alex-001][Alex]]
:Location: [[id:loc-coffee-001][Downtown Coffee Collective]]
:END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Navigating Between Scenes and Locations

** Jump to Location Profile

When in a scene with a linked location:

1. Move cursor to the ~:Location:~ property line
2. Press: ~C-c C-o~ (org-open-at-point)

OR

Press: ~F8 F8 L j~ (Location menu, jump)

You jump to the full location profile!

** Return to Scene

After viewing the location profile:

Press: ~C-c &~ (org-mark-ring-goto)

You return to your original scene.

** Why This Is Useful

While writing:
- "Wait, what color are the walls?" → Jump to profile, check, return
- "How does this place smell again?" → Quick reference
- "Who owns this place?" → Check property

* Searching for Scenes by Location

Find all scenes set in a specific location.

** Command

Press: ~F8 F8 4~ (search by location)

Or use: ~M-x org-scribe/org-find-location~

** Process

1. You'll see: ~Search for location:~
2. Start typing location name: ~Coffee~
3. Matching locations appear
4. Select one: ~Downtown Coffee Collective~
5. Press: ~Enter~

** Results

A buffer opens showing ALL scenes with that location:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Results for location "Downtown Coffee Collective":

*** Scene 1 - Morning Routine
    Chapter 1: The Beginning

*** Scene 5 - Unexpected Meeting
    Chapter 2: Complications

*** Scene 12 - Confrontation
    Chapter 4: Crisis Point

Found 3 scenes.
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Use Cases

- "Where have I used this location?" → See full list
- "Am I overusing this setting?" → Count scenes
- "What's happened here so far?" → Review all scenes
- "Continuity check" → Ensure consistent descriptions

* Tracking Setting Variety

Avoid setting too many scenes in the same location.

** The Problem

It's easy to default to the same settings:
- 10 scenes in Alex's apartment
- 8 scenes in the coffee shop
- 2 scenes everywhere else combined

This gets boring for readers (and you!).

** The Solution: Location Audit

Periodically check location distribution:

1. Search each primary location (F8 F8 4)
2. Count scenes per location
3. Identify overused settings
4. Plan scenes in underused locations

** Healthy Distribution (Novel)

For a novel with 50-70 scenes:
- 3-5 primary locations: 5-10 scenes each
- 5-10 secondary locations: 2-4 scenes each
- 10-20 minor locations: 1 scene each

** Example Audit

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Location Audit (30 scenes written):

Primary:
- Coffee shop: 6 scenes ✓ (balanced)
- Alex's apartment: 11 scenes ⚠ (too many!)
- Office: 4 scenes ✓ (balanced)

Secondary:
- Sam's bookstore: 3 scenes ✓
- Washington Park: 2 scenes ✓
- Subway: 1 scene ✓

Minor:
- Jordan's loft: 1 scene ✓
- Art gallery: 1 scene ✓
- Rooftop bar: 1 scene ✓

Action: Write next 3 scenes outside Alex's apartment!
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Converting Existing Scenes

Already have scenes with plain-text locations?

** Convert Individual Scene

1. Navigate to scene with plain-text location
2. Press: ~F8 F8 L l~ (Location menu, link scene)

Or use: ~M-x org-scribe/link-scene-location~

This finds the location name in your profiles and replaces it with an ID link.

** Convert All Scenes (Batch)

Press: ~F8 F8 L L~ (capital L - link all)

Or use: ~M-x org-scribe/link-all-scene-locations~

This processes your entire manuscript, converting all matching location names to ID links.

*Warning*: Review results! Ambiguous names might match incorrectly.

* TODO Location Timeline
*NOTE:* This function doesn't exist yet. It's an hallucination.

Like character timelines, you can visualize location usage.

** What Is It?

A table showing which locations appear in which scenes.

** Generating Timeline

In your novel.org file, find the "Location Timeline" section (or create one):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Progress Tracking

** TODO Location Timeline
*NOTE:* This function doesn't exist. It's an hallucination.

#+BEGIN: location-timeline
#+END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

Put cursor on ~#+BEGIN:~ line and press: ~C-c C-c~

** TODO Example Output
*NOTE:* This function doesn't exist. It's an hallucination.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Scene           | Chapter   | Coffee Shop | Apartment | Office | Park |
|-----------------+-----------+-------------+-----------+--------|------|
| Scene 1         | Chapter 1 | ●           |           |        |      |
| Scene 2         | Chapter 1 |             | ●         |        |      |
| Scene 3         | Chapter 1 | ●           |           |        | ●    |
| Scene 4         | Chapter 2 |             |           | ●      |      |
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Interpreting Symbols

- *●* = Scene takes place at this location
- *(blank)* = Location not used

** Use Cases

1. **Visual Distribution**: See at a glance which locations dominate
2. **Gap Detection**: Notice locations that appear once then disappear
3. **Pattern Recognition**: See if certain locations cluster together
4. **Variety Check**: Ensure you're moving between settings

* Practical Exercise (15 minutes)

Let's practice location management end-to-end.

** Part 1: Capture Two Locations (7 minutes)

1. Open your manuscript
2. Find or create a scene
3. Press: ~F8 F8 L L~ (Location linking menu)
4. Select Location 1
5. Verify the ~:Location:~ property now has an ID link
6. Navigate to another scene
7. Repeat with Location 2

** Part 3: Test Navigation and Search (4 minutes)

*** Test Navigation:
1. In a scene with linked location
2. Press: ~C-c C-o~ on the Location property
3. Jump to location profile → Success!
4. Press: ~C-c &~ to return → Success!

*** Test Search:
1. Press: ~F8 F8 4~

3. See results → Should show scene(s) you just linked
4. Press ~q~ to close results

** Success Criteria

✓ You captured 2 location profiles with IDs
✓ Location files (objects/locations.org or notes.org) contain your locations
✓ At least 2 scenes have linked locations in their properties
✓ You can jump from scene to location profile and back
✓ Search finds scenes by location

* Integration with Your Daily Writing Workflow

** During Planning

- Capture primary locations before drafting
- Include sensory details for immersion
- Note significance and connections
- Reference when outlining scenes

** During Drafting

- Before writing a scene in a location:
  1. Jump to location profile
  2. Review sensory details
  3. Check continuity notes
  4. Return and write scene
- After using a location for first time:
  - Fill in ~:First-appearance:~ property
- When introducing a new location mid-draft:
  - Pause, press F8 F8 l
  - Quick capture (5-minute version)
  - Link to scene immediately

** During Revision

- Search each location to check consistency:
  - Are descriptions consistent?
  - Do sensory details match?
  - Any contradictions?
- Check variety:
  - Audit location distribution
  - Rewrite/move scenes if overusing a location
- Update profiles:
  - Add details revealed during drafting
  - Update Notes section with what reader knows

** Weekly Maintenance

- Review location timeline
- Note locations that need more development
- Check for forgotten settings
- Plan scenes in underused locations

* Common Questions

** Q: Do I need a profile for every location?

*A*: No! Only locations that:
- Appear more than once, OR
- Have important story significance, OR
- Need consistent description

You don't need profiles for:
- Brief mentions ("they walked past a hardware store")
- Generic settings ("a restaurant" with no specific details)
- One-line locations ("the sidewalk")

** Q: How detailed should Physical Description be?

*A*: Write enough that you can:
1. Visualize the space clearly
2. Write sensory details in scenes
3. Maintain consistency

For most locations, 1-2 paragraphs is sufficient. For critical locations (protagonist's home, key meeting places), go deeper.

** Q: What if my location changes during the story?

*A*: Update the profile! In the Notes section, track the evolution:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Notes

*** Evolution
- [Chapter 1-5]: Messy, dishes in sink, laundry everywhere
- [Chapter 6]: Alex cleans up (turning point)
- [Chapter 7-12]: Tidy, plants on windowsill, organized
#+END_EXAMPLE

This helps you remember which version of the location exists at which point in the story.

** Q: Can I have multiple scenes in "Apartment" without being more specific?

*A*: Yes, but consider breaking it down:
- Alex's Apartment - Living Room
- Alex's Apartment - Bedroom
- Alex's Apartment - Kitchen

Each can have its own profile with specific details. This provides more variety and clearer staging for scenes.

** Q: Should I link generic locations like "Street" or "Car"?

*A*: Usually no. Link specific instances:
- "Main Street" (if it's a recurring setting)
- "Alex's Car" (if it's important and reappears)
- "The Red Line Train" (if it's a regular location)

Don't link generic "a street" or "a car" - those don't need consistency tracking.

** Q: How do I handle locations that only exist in one scene but are important?

*A*: Create a profile with:
- Importance: Minor
- Detailed description (since it's important)
- Significance: Explain why this one scene matters

Example: The rooftop where the protagonist makes a crucial decision - appears once, but needs vivid description and emotional weight.

* Troubleshooting

** "I captured a location but can't find it"

*** Problem
The location was captured but doesn't appear in the locations file.

*** Solution
1. Check the correct file:
   - Novel: ~objects/locations.org~
   - Short story: ~notes.org~ (under "Setting → Locations")
2. Open the file and search: ~C-s~ then type location name
3. If not found, the capture might have failed - try again

** "Location linking menu shows no locations"

*** Problem
Pressing F8 F8 L L shows empty list.

*** Solution
1. Ensure you have captured at least one location
2. Open objects/locations.org or notes.org
3. Verify locations are level-1 headings with ~:ID:~ properties
4. If IDs are missing, run: ~M-x org-scribe/add-location-ids~

** "Search finds no scenes for a location I know I linked"

*** Problem
Search returns 0 results despite linked scenes.

*** Solution
1. Open a scene that should have this location
2. Check the ~:Location:~ property
3. Verify it's an ID link: ~[[id:...][Name]]~
4. If it's plain text, run: ~M-x org-scribe/link-scene-location~
5. Try search again

** "Jump to location doesn't work"

*** Problem
~C-c C-o~ on Location property doesn't jump.

*** Solution
1. Ensure the location property is an ID link (has ~[[id:...]]~ syntax)
2. Put cursor directly on the link text
3. Verify the location profile still exists and has that ID
4. If the ID is orphaned, re-link manually

* Tips for Better Location Management

** 1. Capture Early, Fill Later

When a new location appears in your draft:
- Immediately capture it (just name + basic properties)
- Fill detailed description later during revision
- This prevents forgetting about the location

** 2. Use Real-World Inspiration

Base fictional locations on real places:
- Visit and take notes (or use memory)
- Photograph details
- Record sensory impressions
- Change enough to make it yours

Reference the real place in your Notes section.

** 3. Create a Mental Map

For complex settings (entire neighborhoods, buildings with multiple rooms):
- List all related locations in Connections
- Note spatial relationships ("upstairs from", "across the street from")
- Consider sketching a map (store in Notes as image link)

** 4. Balance Familiarity and Novelty

- Familiar locations (home, workplace) → Less description, more emotion
- Novel locations (first-time visits) → More description, character's reaction

Update your profile to note which scenes establish vs. revisit the location.

** 5. Leverage Sensory Details

For each location, identify its signature sense:
- Coffee shop → Smell (coffee, pastries)
- Office → Sound (phones, keyboards, air conditioning)
- Forest → Touch (rough bark, cool air)
- Beach → Sound (waves, gulls) + Touch (sand, wind)

Lead with that sense when writing scenes there.

** 6. Track Revealed Details

In the Notes section, maintain a list of what readers know:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** Revealed to Reader
- [Chapter 1] Front door is blue
- [Chapter 3] Kitchen has large window
- [Chapter 5] Creaky floorboard in hallway
- [Chapter 8] Bookshelf in living room
#+END_EXAMPLE

This prevents:
- Revealing the same detail twice ("As if for the first time")
- Contradicting earlier descriptions

** 7. Use Location as Character

Important locations can function like characters:
- They have personality (atmosphere)
- They affect characters emotionally
- They can change over time
- They participate in the story

Treat your protagonist's home or a central gathering place with the same care as a secondary character.

** 8. Audit Regularly

Every 10-15 scenes, run a location audit:
- Which locations are dominating?
- Which haven't been used in 20+ scenes?
- Are there too many one-off locations?
- Do you need to consolidate similar locations?

** 9. Connect Locations Thematically

Group locations by theme or function:
- "Safe spaces" vs. "danger zones"
- "Public" vs. "private"
- "Past" (childhood locations) vs. "present"
- "Work life" vs. "home life"

Note these connections in the Connections section.

** 10. Let Locations Surprise You

Sometimes you'll invent a location for a single scene and it becomes important:
- A background location becomes a key setting
- A minor location reveals character depth
- A throwaway scene in a new place sparks plot ideas

When this happens, upgrade the location:
- Change Importance: Minor → Secondary or Primary
- Expand the profile
- Plan additional scenes there

* What You've Learned

Congratulations! You've completed Lesson 5. You now know:

✓ Why location tracking improves consistency and variety
✓ The different types of locations (primary, secondary, minor, atmospheric)
✓ How to use the location capture template (6 sections)
✓ All location properties and when to use them
✓ How to link locations to scenes using ID-based links
✓ How to navigate between scenes and location profiles
✓ How to search for all scenes in a specific location
✓ How to track setting variety with location audits
✓ How to generate location timelines
✓ How to integrate location management into daily writing

* Next Steps

You're ready for **Lesson 6: Plot Threads and Timeline**!

In the next lesson, you'll learn:
- How to create plot thread profiles
- Tracking multiple plot lines through your story
- Linking plot threads to scenes
- Generating plot timelines and health reports
- Ensuring balanced plot development
- Finding gaps in plot progression

** Quick Practice Before Moving On

Before Lesson 6, try this:

1. Capture 3-5 locations for your project:
   - At least one primary location
   - At least two secondary locations
2. Link each location to 1-2 scenes
3. Test jumping from scene to profile and back
4. Search for a location and review which scenes use it
5. Do a location audit:
   - Count scenes per location
   - Identify your most-used setting
   - Identify underused settings

Take your time! Location work is foundational for immersive writing. When you feel comfortable with capturing, linking, and searching locations, move on to Lesson 6.

* Summary

Locations ground your story in physical space and help readers visualize your world. By creating location profiles, you:
- Maintain consistency across multiple scenes
- Track setting variety to avoid repetition
- Quick-reference details while drafting
- Build a coherent fictional geography
- Search instantly for all scenes in a location

The location linking system uses ID-based links, just like characters, allowing you to click from scene properties directly to full location profiles. This makes it easy to check details, ensure consistency, and manage complex settings.

With location management in place, your story now has both *who* (characters) and *where* (locations) fully tracked. Next, you'll learn to track *what happens* with plot threads!
