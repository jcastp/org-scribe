#+TITLE: Lesson 9: Writing Modes Deep Dive
#+AUTHOR: Javier Castilla
#+DATE: 2025-11-16
#+STARTUP: overview

* Welcome to Lesson 9!

You've been using writing mode (~F8 F8 m~) throughout the previous lessons, but ~org-scribe~ actually offers *four different modes* for different writing workflows. Each mode transforms your environment in unique ways to support specific tasks.

In this lesson, we'll explore all four modes in detail and learn when to use each one.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have:
- Understood all four writing modes and their purposes
- Learned the specific features each mode provides
- Practiced switching between modes efficiently
- Discovered which mode fits your personal writing style
- Customized mode settings to your preferences

*Estimated time*: 15-20 minutes

* Before You Begin

** What You Need

✓ A writing project open with at least one scene
✓ Some written content (200+ words recommended)
✓ Familiarity with the Hydra menu (~F8 F8~)

** Optional Dependencies

Some modes work better with optional packages:
- *All modes*: ~writeroom-mode~ (required for modes 1-2)
- *Project mode*: ~treemacs~ and ~imenu-list~ (recommended)
- *Editing mode*: ~imenu-list~ and ~visual-fill-column~ (recommended)
- *Theming*: ~consult~ and ~fontaine~ (optional but nice)

Don't worry if you don't have all of these - we'll explain which features need what!

* The Four Writing Modes

~org-scribe~ provides four mutually exclusive modes:

** Overview Table

| Mode             | Key  | Purpose                       | Best For                      |
|------------------+------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------|
| Distraction-Free | ~m~    | Clean, focused writing        | Daily writing, first drafts   |
| Focus Mode       | ~f~    | One section at a time         | Intensive scene work          |
| Project Mode     | ~p~    | Navigation + writing          | Complex projects, jumping     |
| Editing Mode     | ~e~    | Three-pane editing layout     | Revision, notes integration   |

** Mutual Exclusivity

*Important*: Only one mode can be active at a time!

When you activate a mode:
1. Any other active mode automatically deactivates
2. Previous settings are restored before the new mode activates
3. This prevents conflicts and maintains clean state

*What this means*:
- ~F8 F8 m~ when Focus Mode is active → Focus exits, Distraction-Free activates
- ~F8 F8 p~ when Editing Mode is active → Editing exits, Project activates
- Activating the same mode again → Exits that mode (toggle behavior)

** Quick Summary

Before we dive deep, here's the essence of each mode:

1. *Distraction-Free* (~m~): Clean canvas, no distractions, just you and words
2. *Focus* (~f~): Like Distraction-Free, but shows only current section
3. *Project* (~p~): Two navigation panels + writing area (overview + detail)
4. *Editing* (~e~): Three panels - outline + manuscript + notes (serious revision)

* Mode 1: Distraction-Free Writing Mode

** What It Does

Activates: ~F8 F8 m~

*Visual changes*:
- Switches to clean, minimal theme (default: ~poet~)
- Changes font to writing preset (larger, more readable)
- Enables ~writeroom-mode~ (centers text, hides mode line)
- Shows line numbers
- Narrows text width to comfortable reading (default: 80 columns)

*The result*: A clean, centered, distraction-free writing canvas

** When to Use

Perfect for:
- Daily writing sessions (your default mode)
- First draft writing (no distractions needed)
- Getting into flow state
- Timed writing sprints
- When you want to focus purely on words

*Not ideal for*:
- Navigation between scenes (no outline visible)
- Reference checking (can't see notes)
- Structural editing (need broader view)

** How It Works

1. *Before activation*: Normal Emacs with your usual theme, windows, etc.
2. *Press* ~F8 F8 m~
3. *Screen changes*:
   - Theme switches (dark/complex → light/minimal)
   - Font increases (easier reading)
   - Text centers on screen
   - Mode line simplifies
   - Everything but your text fades away
4. *Write freely!*
5. *Press* ~F8 F8 m~ again to exit
6. *Everything restores*: Theme, font, windows - all back to normal

** Customization Variables

Control how Distraction-Free mode looks:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Theme while writing
(setq my-writing-env-work-theme 'poet)  ; or modus-operandi, etc.

;; Normal theme (restored when exiting)
(setq my-writing-env-normal-theme 'ef-deuteranopia-dark)

;; Font preset while writing (requires fontaine)
(setq my-writing-env-work-font 'writing-big)

;; Normal font preset
(setq my-writing-env-normal-font 'regular)

;; Text width (columns)
(setq my-writing-env-work-width 80)  ; narrower = more focused
#+END_SRC

** Try It Now!

1. Open your manuscript
2. Press ~F8 F8 m~
3. Observe the transformation
4. Write 100 words (experience the environment)
5. Press ~F8 F8 m~ again
6. Notice how everything restores

* Mode 2: Focus Mode

** What It Does

Activates: ~F8 F8 f~

*Everything from Distraction-Free mode, PLUS*:
- Narrows buffer to current org section
- Shows *only* the scene/chapter at point
- Everything else disappears temporarily

*The result*: Laser focus on a single section

** When to Use

Perfect for:
- Intensive work on one scene
- Rewriting a difficult section
- When rest of manuscript is distracting
- Final polish on specific scenes
- Getting unstuck on a problem section

*Not ideal for*:
- First drafts (you might want to see context)
- Jumping between scenes (must widen, navigate, narrow again)
- Checking continuity (need to see other scenes)

** The Difference from Distraction-Free

| Aspect         | Distraction-Free      | Focus Mode                 |
|----------------+-----------------------+----------------------------|
| *Visibility*     | Entire manuscript     | Current section only       |
| *Scrolling*      | Can scroll anywhere   | Scrolls within section     |
| *Navigation*     | All headings visible  | Only current heading       |
| *Mental Model*   | "Work on manuscript"  | "Work on THIS scene"       |
| *When to Exit*   | After writing session | After finishing section    |

** How It Works

1. *Position cursor* on the scene/chapter you want to focus on
2. *Press* ~F8 F8 f~
3. *Buffer narrows*:
   - Only current subtree visible
   - Everything else hidden (not deleted!)
   - Scrolling limited to visible content
   - Plus all Distraction-Free mode effects
4. *Work on that section*
5. *Press* ~F8 F8 f~ again to exit
6. *Buffer widens*: Full manuscript visible again + normal environment restored

** Practical Workflow

*Scenario*: Scene 3 needs rewriting, but seeing other scenes distracts you.

1. Navigate to Scene 3 heading
2. ~F8 F8 f~ (activate Focus mode)
3. Now you see ONLY Scene 3
4. Rewrite intensively
5. ~F8 F8 f~ (exit)
6. Full manuscript visible again
7. Navigate to Scene 4
8. ~F8 F8 f~ (focus on Scene 4)
9. Repeat...

** Customization

Focus mode uses the same customization as Distraction-Free mode:
- Same theme settings
- Same font settings
- Same width settings

No separate configuration needed!

** Try It Now!

1. Open manuscript
2. Navigate to a specific scene heading
3. Press ~F8 F8 f~
4. Notice: only that scene visible
5. Try scrolling - you can't leave the scene
6. Press ~F8 F8 f~ to exit
7. Full manuscript visible again

* Mode 3: Project Mode

** What It Does

Activates: ~F8 F8 p~

*Layout changes*:
- Opens ~treemacs~ on the left (project file tree)
- Opens ~imenu-list~ on the right (current file outline)
- Main buffer in center (your manuscript)
- Three-panel layout for navigation + writing

*The result*: Overview of project structure + document outline + writing area

** When to Use

Perfect for:
- Complex projects with many files
- Jumping between planning files and manuscript
- Navigating large manuscripts quickly
- When you need structural overview
- Managing multiple chapters/sections

*Not ideal for*:
- Pure writing (panels are distracting)
- Small screens (too cramped)
- Short stories (unnecessary complexity)

** The Three Panels Explained

*** Left Panel: Imenu-List (Outline)

*Purpose*: Navigate your manuscript structure

*Shows*:
- All headings in manuscript
- Hierarchical organization

*Use for*:
- Jumping to scenes
- Seeing structure
- Quick navigation

*** Center Panel: Main Buffer (Manuscript)

*Purpose*: Your actual editing area

*Shows*:
- The manuscript you're editing
- Centered with margins for readability

*Use for*:
- Making edits
- Reading scenes
- Main revision work

*** Right Panel: Notes File

*Purpose*: Companion notes for manuscript

*Shows*:
- File named ~[manuscript]-notes.org~
- Example: ~novel.org~ → ~novel-notes.org~
- Your revision notes, ideas, TODOs

*Use for*:
- Writing editing notes
- Tracking issues to fix
- Recording ideas
- Managing revision checklist

** Notes File Creation

When you activate Editing mode:
1. If ~novel-notes.org~ exists → opens it
2. If it doesn't exist → creates it automatically
3. New file is blank (ready for your notes)

*Notes file naming*:
- ~novel.org~ → ~novel-notes.org~
- ~story.org~ → ~story-notes.org~
- ~manuscript.org~ → ~manuscript-notes.org~

** How It Works

1. *Open your manuscript* (e.g., ~novel.org~)
2. *Press* ~F8 F8 e~
3. *Frame splits into three*:
   - All other windows close
   - Imenu-list appears (left, 25%)
   - Your manuscript stays (center, 50%)
   - Notes file opens/creates (right, 25%)
4. *Visual profile applies*:
   - Theme changes to editing theme (default: ~leuven~)
   - Font changes to editing preset
   - Text centering with margins
5. *Edit freely*, jump between panels
6. *Press* ~F8 F8 e~ to exit
7. *Previous layout restores*: Windows, theme, font - all back

** Workflow Example

*Scenario*: Revising Chapter 3 with specific notes.

1. Open ~novel.org~
2. ~F8 F8 e~ (activate Editing mode)
3. ~novel-notes.org~ opens automatically (right panel)
4. In notes panel, write:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   * Chapter 3 Revision
   ** Scene 1
   - [ ] Fix pacing (too slow)
   - [ ] Add dialogue
   - [ ] Show Alex's reaction
   #+END_EXAMPLE
5. Click "Scene 1" in left panel (imenu-list)
6. Center panel jumps to Scene 1
7. Read scene while referencing notes
8. Make edits in center panel
9. Check off items in right panel (notes)
10. Navigate to next scene via left panel
11. Repeat revision process
12. ~F8 F8 e~ when done - layout closes, work saved

** Integration with org-remark

If you use ~org-remark~ for annotations:
- Highlights in manuscript link to notes file
- Notes file contains annotation details
- Editing mode shows both simultaneously
- Perfect for detailed revision work

*Not required*: You can use Editing mode without org-remark!

** Combining Modes with Workflow

*Morning routine*:
1. ~F8 F8 p~ - Check what needs writing (project overview)
2. Navigate to today's scene
3. ~F8 F8 m~ - Switch to distraction-free
4. Write for 1 hour
5. ~F8 F8 m~ - Exit, check progress

*Revision routine*:
1. ~F8 F8 e~ - Activate editing mode
2. Review notes in right panel
3. Work through revision checklist
4. Make edits in center panel
5. Update notes as you go
6. ~F8 F8 e~ - Exit when done

* Practical Exercises (15 minutes)

Let's practice using all four modes.

** Exercise 1: Mode Tour (5 minutes)

*Goal*: Experience each mode's unique environment

1. *Distraction-Free*:
   - Open manuscript
   - ~F8 F8 m~
   - Write 50 words
   - Notice: clean, centered, minimal
   - ~F8 F8 m~ (exit)

2. *Focus*:
   - Position on a scene heading
   - ~F8 F8 f~
   - Write 50 words
   - Notice: only this scene visible
   - Try scrolling past scene boundaries (you can't!)
   - ~F8 F8 f~ (exit)

3. *Project*:
   - ~F8 F8 p~
   - Click different headings in imenu-list
   - See cursor jump
   - Notice three-panel layout
   - ~F8 F8 p~ (exit)

4. *Editing*:
   - ~F8 F8 e~
   - Add a note in right panel: "* Test note"
   - Click outline items on left

* Advanced Customization

** Customizing Distraction-Free and Focus Modes

Both modes use the same variables:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; In your init.el or .emacs:

;; === THEMES ===
;; Writing mode theme (clean, minimal)
(setq my-writing-env-work-theme 'poet)
;; Options: poet, modus-operandi, ef-light, leuven

;; Normal theme (your regular Emacs theme)
(setq my-writing-env-normal-theme 'modus-vivendi)
;; Use whatever theme you normally use

;; === FONTS (requires fontaine package) ===
;; Writing mode font preset
(setq my-writing-env-work-font 'writing-big)

;; Normal font preset
(setq my-writing-env-normal-font 'regular)

;; === TEXT WIDTH ===
;; Writing mode width (columns)
(setq my-writing-env-work-width 80)
;; 60-70: very narrow, intense focus
;; 80: classic, comfortable
;; 90-100: wider, more context

;; Normal mode width (not used much)
(setq my-writing-env-normal-width 90)
#+END_SRC

** Customizing Editing Mode

Editing mode has separate settings:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; === PANEL SIZES ===
;; Left panel (imenu-list) width
(setq writing-editing-left-width-percent 0.25)  ; 25%

;; Right panel (notes) width
(setq writing-editing-right-width-percent 0.25) ; 25%

;; (Center panel is automatic: 1.0 - left - right)

;; === VISUAL STYLE ===
;; Editing theme
(setq writing-editing-theme 'leuven)
;; Good options: leuven, modus-operandi, ef-light

;; Text column width
(setq writing-editing-fill-column-width 90)
;; Wider than writing mode (more context for editing)

;; Font preset (requires fontaine)
(setq writing-editing-fontaine-preset 'editing)
#+END_SRC

** Example: Narrow Focus Configuration

For intense, narrow focus:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Very narrow, very minimal
(setq my-writing-env-work-theme 'poet)
(setq my-writing-env-work-width 60)  ; Very narrow!
(setq my-writing-env-work-font 'writing-huge)
#+END_SRC

** Example: Wide Editing Configuration

For more context during revision:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Wider panels, more information
(setq writing-editing-left-width-percent 0.20)   ; Narrower outline
(setq writing-editing-right-width-percent 0.30)  ; Wider notes
(setq writing-editing-fill-column-width 100)     ; Wide text
#+END_SRC

** Font Presets (Fontaine)

If using Fontaine, define presets in your config:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq fontaine-presets
      '((regular
         :default-height 120)
        (writing-big
         :default-family "iA Writer Quattro"  ; Or your preference
         :default-height 160                  ; Larger for writing
         :line-spacing 0.3)                  ; More space between lines
        (writing-huge
         :default-height 180)
        (editing
         :default-height 140                  ; Medium size
         :line-spacing 0.2)))
#+END_SRC

** Theme Recommendations

*** For Writing (Distraction-Free)
- ~poet~ - Designed for prose, very clean
- ~modus-operandi~ - Highly accessible, minimal
- ~ef-light~ - Soft, easy on eyes
- ~writeroom-mode~ default - Ultra minimal

*** For Editing
- ~leuven~ - Professional, clear structure
- ~modus-operandi~ - Consistent, accessible
- ~dichromacy~ - High contrast for editing
- ~ef-light~ - Gentle but clear

*** For Normal Work
- Whatever you normally use!
- The modes restore your normal theme automatically

* Common Questions

** "Which mode should I use for daily writing?"

*Answer*: Distraction-Free mode (~F8 F8 m~)

It's the most popular for daily writing because:
- Clean, minimal interface
- Easy to activate/deactivate
- No navigation panels to distract
- Full manuscript visible (can scroll to reference earlier scenes)
- Fast toggle (same key enters and exits)

** "Can I use writing modes outside of org-scribe projects?"

*Answer*: Technically yes, but some features require project structure.

- Distraction-Free (~m~) works anywhere
- Focus (~f~) works in any org-mode file
- Project (~p~) needs a project (any project.el project)
- Editing (~e~) works with any file (creates matching notes file)

Best experience is within a proper writing project!

** "Do modes save my theme/font permanently?"

*Answer*: No, changes are temporary.

- Modes change theme/font when activated
- Original settings are saved
- Exiting mode restores original settings
- Your actual Emacs configuration is unchanged

This is intentional - modes are temporary environments!

** "Why can't I have Project mode AND Distraction-Free at once?"

*Answer*: They conflict in their goals.

- Distraction-Free hides everything → minimal
- Project shows panels → maximal navigation
- These are opposite approaches
- Mutual exclusivity prevents confusion

Choose the right tool for your current task!

** "Can I customize which panels Editing mode shows?"

*Answer*: Currently, the panels are fixed (imenu-list + notes).

But you can:
- Adjust panel widths (percentages)
- Choose different theme
- Change text width
- Use different font

*Future enhancement*: Customizable panel content is planned!

** "What if I don't have treemacs/imenu-list installed?"

*Answer*: Modes gracefully handle missing packages.

- Project mode (~p~): Shows warning, some features missing
- Editing mode (~e~): Works but no imenu-list panel
- Distraction-Free/Focus (~m~/~f~): Require writeroom-mode (show error)

Install recommended packages for full experience!

** "Can I create my own custom mode?"

*Answer*: Advanced users can!

Study existing modes in ~modes/writing-modes.el~:
1. Create a minor mode
2. Add to ~my-writing-exclusive-modes~ list
3. Call ~my-writing--deactivate-other-modes~ when activating
4. Save/restore state appropriately

This is advanced - stick with the four built-in modes initially!

* Troubleshooting

** "Mode activates but looks wrong/broken"

*Check*:
1. Do you have required packages installed?
   - Distraction-Free/Focus need: ~writeroom-mode~
   - Project needs: ~treemacs~ and ~imenu-list~
   - Editing needs: ~imenu-list~

2. Are themes installed?
   - ~M-x customize-themes~ to see available
   - Install missing themes via package manager

3. Is your frame wide enough?
   - Editing mode needs ~120+ columns
   - Project mode needs ~100+ columns
   - Narrow terminal? Modes may look cramped

** "Exiting mode doesn't restore everything"

*Try*:
1. Activate the mode again: ~F8 F8 X~ (where X is the mode key)
2. Exit properly: ~F8 F8 X~ again
3. If still broken: ~M-x revert-buffer~ or close/reopen file

*Prevention*:
- Always exit modes with the same key that activated them
- Don't kill buffers while mode is active
- Don't force-quit Emacs while in a writing mode

** "Focus mode won't narrow / stays wide"

*Causes*:
1. Cursor not on an org heading
2. Not in org-mode buffer
3. Already at top level (can't narrow to whole file)

*Solution*:
- Position cursor on a scene or chapter heading (*** or **)
- Make sure buffer is in ~org-mode~
- Try from a deeper heading (not the document title)

** "Project mode panels are too wide/narrow"

*Solution*:
- Panels size is controlled by the packages themselves
- For imenu-list: ~M-x customize-variable RET imenu-list-size~
- For treemacs: ~M-x customize-variable RET treemacs-width~
- Adjust and restart Project mode

** "Editing mode notes file opens in wrong place"

*Expected behavior*:
- Notes file is always in same directory as manuscript
- Named: ~[manuscript-name]-notes.org~

If opening elsewhere:
- Check current buffer's ~buffer-file-name~
- Notes file derives from this name
- Make sure manuscript is saved to disk (not unnamed buffer)

** "Themes don't change when mode activates"

*Possible causes*:
1. Theme not installed
2. Consult package not available (uses fallback)
3. Custom theme variable not set

*Solutions*:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Check current theme
(custom-enabled-themes)

;; Manually test theme switching
(load-theme 'poet t)

;; Install consult for smoother theme switching
M-x package-install RET consult RET
#+END_SRC

** Quick Decision Guide

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
What do I want to do?

WRITE → m (Distraction-Free)
  └─ One scene needs work? → f (Focus)

NAVIGATE → p (Project)
  └─ Between files? → p
  └─ Within file? → p (imenu-list panel)

REVISE → e (Editing)
  └─ With notes? → e
  └─ Just reading? → m (cleaner)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Essential Commands

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Activate modes: F8 F8 + (m/f/p/e)
Exit mode: F8 F8 + (same key) [toggles]
Force exit all: (none needed - modes are well-behaved!)

Navigation in Focus mode:
  Widen: C-x n w (but this defeats the purpose!)
  Better: Exit Focus, navigate, re-enter Focus

Resize panels (Project/Editing):
  Customize variables (see Customization section)
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Summary

Writing modes transform your Emacs environment to support different writing tasks. Distraction-Free mode creates a clean canvas for daily writing. Focus mode laser-focuses on one section. Project mode adds navigation for complex projects. Editing mode provides a professional revision environment with notes.

The key to mastery is:
1. Understanding what each mode does
2. Matching mode to task
3. Practicing smooth transitions
4. Finding your preferred mode for each task type
5. Customizing to your personal taste

Start simple (just Distraction-Free mode), then explore others as your needs grow!
