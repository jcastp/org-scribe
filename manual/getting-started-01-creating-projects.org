#+TITLE: Lesson 1: Creating Your First Project
#+AUTHOR: Javier Castilla
#+DATE: 2025-11-16
#+STARTUP: overview

* Welcome to Lesson 1!

In this lesson, you'll create your first writing project using ~org-scribe~. This is the foundation for everything else - all other features work within a project structure.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have:
- Created a complete novel or short story project
- Understood the project file structure
- Opened and explored the template files
- Written your first sentence in the manuscript

*Estimated time*: 10-15 minutes

* Before You Begin

** Make Sure You're Ready

Check that you have:
- ✓ Emacs open and running
- ✓ ~org-scribe~ package installed and loaded
- ✓ A directory where you want to store your writing projects (we'll use ~~/org-scribe/~ in examples)

** Quick Test

Let's verify the package is loaded correctly:

1. Press ~M-x~ (Alt+x or Option+x)
2. Start typing: ~writing-version~
3. Press Enter

You should see a message like: *"org-scribe version 0.2.0 (includes project templates)"*

If you see this message, you're ready! If not, make sure you've installed the package correctly.

* Understanding Project Types

~org-scribe~ offers two types of projects:

** Novel Projects (Full Template)

*Best for*:
- Long-form fiction (50,000+ words)
- Complex stories with multiple characters and plots
- Stories requiring detailed planning and world-building

*What you get*:
- 12-13 files organized in a structured hierarchy
- Separate planning files for characters, locations, plot, timeline, objects
- Statistics tracking section with word count tables
- Revision notes file
- Research and notes directories
- Main manuscript file (novel.org or novela.org)

** Short Story Projects (Minimal Template)

*Best for*:
- Short fiction (1,000-20,000 words)
- Single-sitting stories
- Quick writing projects or exercises
- Stories with fewer characters and simpler plots

*What you get*:
- 3 essential files
- Main story file (story.org or cuento.org) with integrated word tracking
- Consolidated notes file (combines characters, plot, locations in one place)
- README file

*Recommendation for beginners*: Start with a short story project to learn the basics. You can always create a novel project later!

* Creating a Short Story Project

Let's create your first project - a short story. We'll walk through every step.

** Step 1: Invoke the Creation Function

1. Press ~M-x~ (this opens the command prompt)
2. Type: ~writing-create-short-story-project~
3. Press ~Enter~

*Tip*: You can use Tab completion! Type ~writing-cre~ and press Tab to see available commands.

** Step 2: Choose the Base Directory

You'll see a prompt:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Base directory for project: ~/org-scribe/
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is where your project folder will be created.

*What to do*:
- Press ~Enter~ to accept the default (~~/org-scribe/~)
- OR type a different path (like ~~/Documents/org-scribe/~ or ~~/my-stories/~)
- Press ~Enter~

The directory will be created if it doesn't exist.

** Step 3: Enter Your Story Title

You'll see a prompt:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Short story title:
#+END_EXAMPLE

*What to do*:
- Type your story title (for example: ~The Morning Routine~)
- Press ~Enter~

*Title Guidelines*:
- Use simple titles (letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens)
- Avoid special characters: * ? < > | " ' : / \
- Don't start with a dot (.)
- The title will become the project folder name

** Step 4: Wait for Creation

The package will now:
1. Create the project directory
2. Copy and process template files
3. Initialize a git repository
4. Create an initial commit
5. Open the README.org file

You'll see messages in the minibuffer showing progress. This takes just a few seconds.

** Step 5: Success!

When complete, you'll see:
- The README.org file opens in your buffer
- A message: *"Project created successfully!"*
- Your new project is ready!

* Exploring Your Short Story Project

Let's look at what was created. You should now be looking at the README.org file.

** The Project Structure

Your new project has this structure:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
The Morning Routine/           (your project folder)
├── .git/                      (version control - automatic!)
├── .writing-project           (marker file - identifies this as a writing project)
├── README.org                 (overview and quick links - YOU ARE HERE)
├── story.org                  (your main manuscript)
└── notes.org                  (planning: characters, plot, locations, etc.)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Understanding Each File

*** README.org (Currently Open)
This file provides:
- Project overview
- Quick navigation links to other files
- Progress tracking and milestones

*What to do*: Read through it now. It has helpful links and tips!

*** story.org (Your Manuscript)
This is where you'll write your actual story.

*What it contains*:
- Title and metadata (#+TITLE, #+AUTHOR, etc.)
- Three-section structure (Opening, Middle, Ending)
- Scene templates with properties (PoV, Characters, Location, etc.)
- Integrated word count tracking table
- Export configuration

*What to do now*:
1. Look at the README.org file (currently open)
2. Find the link that says: ~[[file:story.org][Main Story File]]~
3. Click it (or press ~C-c C-o~ while cursor is on the link)
4. You'll jump to story.org!

*** notes.org (Planning & Research)
This is your planning hub, containing:
- Characters section (with protagonist template)
- Plot Outline section
- Setting section (with locations subsection)
- Objects section
- Timeline section
- Research & References section
- Revision Notes section
- Random Ideas & Inspiration section

*What to do later*: We'll explore this in Lesson 4 (Capturing Characters).

** The .writing-project Marker File

This hidden file tells Emacs: "This directory is a writing project!"

*What it does*:
- Enables project detection
- Allows capture functions to find the right files
- Stores project type information (novel vs. short story)

*Important*: Don't delete this file! The package needs it.

** Git Integration

Your project is automatically a git repository!

*What this means*:
- All changes are tracked
- You can see your writing history
- You can revert to earlier versions if needed
- You can push to GitHub/GitLab for backup

*Don't worry if you don't know git*: It works automatically. You can learn git later!

* Creating a Novel Project

If you want to create a full novel project instead, the process is almost identical:

** Quick Steps

1. Press ~M-x~
2. Type: ~writing-create-novel-project~
3. Press ~Enter~
4. Choose base directory (e.g., ~~/org-scribe/~)
5. Enter novel title (e.g., ~My Fantasy Novel~)
6. Wait for creation
7. Explore!

** Novel Project Structure

A novel project has more files:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
My Fantasy Novel/
├── .git/
├── .writing-project
├── README.org                 (overview and navigation)
├── novel.org                  (main manuscript - 3-act structure)
├── statistics.org             (word count and progress tracking)
├── revision.org               (revision notes and checklists)
├── objects/                      (planning directory)
│   ├── characters.org         (character database)
│   ├── locations.org          (locations and world-building)
│   ├── plot.org              (plot threads and structure)
│   ├── timeline.org          (story timeline and events)
│   └── objects.org           (important objects/MacGuffins)
└── notes/                     (notes directory)
    ├── notes.org             (general notes)
    └── research.org          (research and references)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** When to Use Novel Template

Choose the novel template if:
- You're planning a work over 50,000 words
- You have multiple characters with complex relationships
- You need detailed world-building
- You have multiple plot threads to track
- You want separate files for different aspects of planning

** Novel vs. Short Story: Which Should I Use?

| Aspect         | Short Story Template     | Novel Template             |
|----------------+--------------------------+----------------------------|
| *Complexity*     | Simple, 3 files          | Complex, 12-13 files       |
| *Word Count*     | 1,000-20,000             | 50,000+                    |
| *Planning*       | Consolidated notes.org   | Separate objects/ files       |
| *Best For*       | Quick projects, learning | Long-form, detailed novels |
| *Word Tracking*  | In story.org             | Separate statistics.org    |
| *Learning Curve* | Gentle                   | Steeper                    |
| *Overhead*       | Minimal                  | More files to manage       |

*Recommendation*: Start with short story template to learn, then try novel template for your big project!

* TODO Bilingual Support (English/Spanish)
*NOTE:* This section is not yet implemented.

The package supports both English and Spanish templates!

** How It Works

The template language is controlled by a configuration variable: ~writing-template-language~

*Default*: ~'en~ (English)

** English Templates Create:
- novel.org (main manuscript)
- story.org (short story)
- notes/ directory
- characters.org, locations.org, plot.org, etc.

** Spanish Templates Create:
- novela.org (manuscrito principal)
- cuento.org (cuento corto)
- notas/ directorio
- personajes.org, localizaciones.org, trama.org, etc.

** Changing Template Language

To use Spanish templates, add this to your Emacs configuration (~init.el~ or ~.emacs~):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq writing-template-language 'es)
#+END_SRC

Then restart Emacs or evaluate the line with ~C-x C-e~.

Now ~writing-create-novel-project~ will create Spanish-language templates!

** Bilingual Projects

*Important*: Choose your language before creating the project. The package detects language by checking which files exist (novel.org vs. novela.org), so mixing languages in one project may confuse the detection.

* Common Issues and Solutions

** "Template directory not found"

*Problem*: The package can't find the template files.

*Solution*:
1. Make sure ~org-scribe~ is properly installed
2. Check that the templates/ directory exists in the package installation
3. Try ~M-x package-reinstall RET org-scribe RET~

** "Project directory already exists"

*Problem*: You're trying to create a project with a name that already exists.

*Solution*:
1. Choose a different title/name
2. OR delete the existing directory if it was a test
3. OR add a version number (e.g., "My Story v2")

** "Invalid project title"

*Problem*: Your title contains special characters.

*Solution*:
1. Use only letters, numbers, spaces, and hyphens
2. Remove characters like: * ? < > | " ' : / \
3. Don't start the title with a dot (.)

** Can't find the created project

*Problem*: Project was created but you don't know where.

*Solution*:
1. Look at the base directory you specified
2. Default is ~~/org-scribe/~
3. Your project is in: ~~/org-scribe/Your-Project-Title/~
4. Use ~M-x dired~ to browse directories

* Your First Writing Session

Now that you have a project, let's write something!

** Quick Exercise (5 minutes)

1. *Open your manuscript*:
   - If you created a short story: Open ~story.org~
   - If you created a novel: Open ~novel.org~

2. *Find the first scene*:
   - Look for a heading like: ~*** Scene 1 - [Title]~
   - Or create one (we'll learn this in Lesson 2)

3. *Write one sentence*:
   - Click below the scene heading
   - Type anything! For example: "The alarm clock rang at 6:30 AM, as it did every morning."

4. *Save the file*:
   - Press ~C-x C-s~

5. *Celebrate*!
   - You've just written your first sentence in ~org-scribe~!

* Troubleshooting Tips

** How to verify your project was created correctly

1. Use ~M-x dired~ to open the project directory
2. You should see:
   - .writing-project file
   - README.org
   - story.org or novel.org
   - notes.org (short story) or objects/ directory (novel)

** How to delete a test project

1. Close all files from that project
2. Use ~M-x dired~ to navigate to the parent directory
3. Mark the project folder with ~d~
4. Execute deletion with ~x~
5. Confirm with ~yes~

** How to re-open a project later

1. Use ~C-x C-f~ (find-file)
2. Navigate to: ~~/org-scribe/Your-Project-Title/~
3. Open ~README.org~ or ~story.org~/~novel.org~
4. The ~.writing-project~ marker ensures the package recognizes it

* Getting Help

If you're stuck:

1. Check the [[file:getting-started-index.org][Tutorial Index]] for other lessons
2. Refer to the [[file:00-feature-index.org][Feature Index]] for detailed feature documentation
3. Use ~C-h f~ followed by a function name for help
4. Ask in the Emacs community or file an issue

* Summary

You've taken your first big step into ~org-scribe~! You now have a real project with a proper structure, version control, and template files ready for your story.

In the next lessons, you'll learn how to actually use all these files effectively. But for now, pat yourself on the back - you're officially set up and ready to write!
