#+TITLE: Lesson 4: Capturing Characters
#+AUTHOR: Javier Castilla
#+DATE: 2025-11-16
#+STARTUP: overview

* Welcome to Lesson 4!

Your story is full of people (or aliens, or dragons, or talking furniture...). Keeping track of them all can be challenging! This lesson teaches you how to create detailed character profiles and link them to your scenes.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have:
- Created your first character profile using the capture template
- Understood all sections of the character template
- Learned how the ID-based linking system works
- Set PoV and character properties with one click
- Searched for all scenes featuring a character
- Generated a character timeline showing who appears where

*Estimated time*: 20 minutes

* Before You Begin

** What You Need

✓ A project with at least one scene written
✓ At least one character in your story
✓ Your manuscript file and notes/plan files accessible

** Quick Check

Think about your main character:
- What's their name?
- What role do they play? (protagonist, antagonist, supporting)
- What do they want?

You don't need all the details yet - we'll develop them together!

* Why Character Profiles Matter

Before we start capturing characters, let's understand why this helps your writing.

** The Problem Without Profiles

When characters live only in your head or scattered through scenes:
- "What color were Alex's eyes again?"
- "Wait, is Sam 32 or 35?"
- "Did I ever mention Jordan's backstory?"
- "Which scenes actually feature Maria?"
- "I haven't shown my antagonist in 10 chapters!"

** The Solution: Centralized Profiles

With character profiles:
- ✓ All details in one place (no inconsistencies!)
- ✓ Click from scenes to full character info
- ✓ Search for all scenes featuring a character
- ✓ Track character appearances across your story
- ✓ Plan character arcs systematically
- ✓ Never forget supporting characters

** Real-World Benefits

*During drafting*:
- Quick reference: "What's Alex's occupation again?"
- Consistency: Same eye color every time
- Development: Arc planning keeps character growth on track

*During revision*:
- Find all Alex scenes (check PoV balance)
- Find all scenes with Alex AND Sam (check relationship development)
- Generate character timeline (ensure protagonists appear regularly)
- Identify "forgotten" characters (only appear once?)

* Understanding Character Files

Before capturing, let's see where characters live.

** Short Story Projects

Characters go in ~notes.org~ under the "Characters" heading:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Characters
** Protagonist: [Name]
   [Your character details]

** Supporting Character: [Name]
   [Your character details]
#+END_EXAMPLE

All characters in one file, organized by role.

** Novel Projects

Characters get their own file: ~plan/characters.org~

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* [Character Name]
  [All details]

* [Another Character Name]
  [All details]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Dedicated file for extensive character database.

** Opening Your Character File

*Quick navigation*:
1. Press ~F8 F8~ (Hydra menu)
2. Press ~o~ (Open file)
3. Select ~characters.org~ or ~notes.org~
4. Press Enter

Or use ~C-x C-f~ and navigate manually.

* Capturing Your First Character

Let's create a character profile using the capture template!

** Step 1: Activate Character Capture

From anywhere in your project:

1. Press ~F8 F8~ (Hydra menu)
2. Press ~h~ (for "cHaracter" - yes, the 'h' is a bit weird, but 'c' was taken!)

The menu closes and you see a prompt.

** Step 2: Enter Character Name

You'll see:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Character Name:
#+END_EXAMPLE

Type your character's name (example: ~Alex Rivera~) and press Enter.

** Step 3: Fill in the Prompts

The template asks for key information. Fill each prompt:

1. *Role*: Choose from Protagonist, Antagonist, Supporting, Minor
   - Example: ~Protagonist~

2. *Age*: Character's age
   - Example: ~28~

3. *Gender*: Character's gender/pronouns
   - Example: ~Non-binary (they/them)~

4. *Occupation*: What they do for a living
   - Example: ~Freelance graphic designer~

5. *First Appearance Chapter*: When they first appear
   - Example: ~Chapter 1~ or ~Opening~

Press Enter after each prompt.

** Step 4: The Template Appears!

After the last prompt, you'll see a complete character profile template:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Alex Rivera
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: char-alex-rivera-20251116-001
:Role: Protagonist
:Age: 28
:Gender: Non-binary (they/them)
:Occupation: Freelance graphic designer

:END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** ~:ID:~ - The Magic Link (Auto-Generated!)

This unique identifier is *automatically created* and is the key to the linking system.

*What it does*:
- Creates a unique ID for this character
- Enables linking from scenes to this profile
- Allows searching and navigation
- Never changes even if you rename the character

*Important*: Don't delete or modify this! The system generated it for you.

*** ~:Role:~ - Character Function

Your character's story role:
- *Protagonist*: Main character, story is about them
- *Antagonist*: Opposes the protagonist
- *Supporting*: Important to the story, helps/hinders protagonist
- *Minor*: Appears briefly, serves specific purpose

*** Other Properties

The template filled these from your prompts:
- ~:Age:~ - Character's age
- ~:Gender:~ - Gender/pronouns
- ~:Occupation:~ - What they do
- ~:First-appearance:~ - When they show up

You can edit these anytime!

** Goal, Motivation, Conflict Section

This section uses the GMC framework (Debra Dixon's method):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Goal, Motivation, Conflict
*** Internal
- Goal ::
- Motivation ::
- Conflict ::
*** External
- Goal ::
- Motivation ::
- Conflict ::
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Internal GMC (Emotional/Psychological)

- Example: "Tired of constant stress and feeling like a mess"

*Conflict*: What prevents them
- Example: "Fear that structure will kill creativity; resistance to change"

*** External GMC (Physical/Plot)

*Goal*: What they want externally
- Example: "Establish a sustainable morning routine"

*Motivation*: Why they want it
- Example: "Keep making the same mistakes (late to meetings, forgot things)"

*Conflict*: What prevents them
- Example: "Old habits deeply ingrained; life keeps throwing curveballs"

*Why GMC matters*: This framework ensures your character has clear goals and obstacles, creating natural conflict!

** Character Arc Section

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Character Arc

- Initial state ::
- Turning point ::
- Transformation ::
- Final state ::
#+END_EXAMPLE

Track your character's journey:

*Example*:

- Remember: Alex says "close enough" about everything (catchphrase)
- TODO: Develop their relationship with their parents more
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Filling Out Your Character Profile

You don't have to fill everything immediately!

** Minimum Profile (5 minutes)

Essential information:
- Name (heading)
- Role, Age, Gender (properties - already filled!)
- Main traits (3-5 adjectives)
- Desire (what they want)
- Initial state and final state (character arc endpoints)

This is enough to start writing!

** Full Profile (20-30 minutes)

Complete all sections when:
- Planning before drafting
- Developing complex characters
- During revision (understanding characters better)
- For main characters only (supporting cast can have minimal profiles)

** Practical Approach

1. *Before writing*: Minimum profile
2. *While writing*: Add details as they emerge
3. *During revision*: Fill in gaps, ensure consistency

The profile grows with your understanding of the character!

* The ID-Based Linking System

Now for the really cool part - linking characters to scenes!

** What is ID-Based Linking?

Remember that ~:ID:~ property? Here's what it enables:

*Traditional approach*:
- Type character name in ~:PoV:~ property
- Type character names in ~:Characters:~ property
- Hope you spelled consistently
- Manual searching

*ID-based linking*:
- Select character from a menu
- System inserts ID link automatically
- Click the link to jump to character profile
- Searches work even if you rename the character
- Character timeline generation

** How Links Look

In your scene properties, instead of plain text:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:PoV: Alex Rivera
:Characters: Alex Rivera, Sam Chen
#+END_EXAMPLE

You get clickable ID links:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:PoV: [[id:char-alex-rivera-001][Alex Rivera]]
:Characters: [[id:char-alex-rivera-001][Alex Rivera]], [[id:char-sam-chen-002][Sam Chen]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

*What you see in the file*: ~[[id:...][Alex Rivera]]~
*What you see in column view*: Just "Alex Rivera" (clean!)

** Benefits of ID Links

1. *Click to navigate*: Press ~C-c C-o~ on a character name → jump to their profile
2. *Return easily*: Press ~C-c &~ to come back
3. *Rename-safe*: Change "Alex" to "Alexander" in profile, all links still work
4. *Smart searches*: Find all scenes with a character, even if link format
5. *Timeline generation*: Automatic character appearance tracking
6. *Consistency*: Can't misspell if you're clicking from a menu!

* Setting PoV Characters (The Easy Way)

Instead of typing character names, use the menu system!

** Step 1: Position at Your Scene

Open your manuscript (story.org or novel.org) and put cursor on a scene heading.

** Step 2: Open Character Linking Menu

1. Press ~F8 F8~ (Hydra menu)
2. Press ~C~ (capital C - for Character submenu)

You'll see the character linking submenu:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
^Character Linking^
_p_: Set PoV character      _l_: Link scene characters
_c_: Set scene characters   _L_: Link all scenes
_j_: Jump to PoV char       _i_: Add IDs to characters
_s_: Setup linking system   _q_: Back to main menu
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Step 3: Set PoV Character

Press ~p~ (for "Set PoV character")

You'll see a completion menu with all your characters:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Set PoV character: [Alex Rivera] [Sam Chen] [Jordan Lee]
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Step 4: Select Character

Start typing the name (e.g., "Alex") and press Tab or Enter to select.

*Magic!* The ~:PoV:~ property is now:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:PoV: [[id:char-alex-rivera-001][Alex Rivera]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Done! No typing, no typos, automatic linking!

* Setting Scene Characters (Multiple Characters)

For the ~:Characters:~ property (who appears in the scene):

** Step 1: Open Character Linking Menu

Same as before: ~F8 F8 C~

** Step 2: Set Scene Characters

Press ~c~ (for "Set scene characters")

** Step 3: Multi-Select Characters

You'll see the same character list, but now you can select multiple:

1. Type/select first character (e.g., "Alex"), press Enter
2. Type/select second character (e.g., "Sam"), press Enter
3. Type/select third character if needed, press Enter
4. Press Enter on empty prompt to finish

** Step 4: Result

The ~:Characters:~ property now has comma-separated ID links:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
:Characters: [[id:char-alex-rivera-001][Alex Rivera]], [[id:char-sam-chen-002][Sam Chen]]
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Beautiful!* All characters linked with one command.

* Jumping to Character Profiles

Need to check a character detail while writing?

** From Scene Property

1. Put cursor on a character name in ~:PoV:~ or ~:Characters:~
2. Press ~C-c C-o~ (org-open-at-point)
3. *Boom!* You're at the character profile

** Using the Menu

1. Cursor on scene heading
2. ~F8 F8 C~ (character submenu)
3. Press ~j~ (jump to PoV character)
4. *Boom!* At the PoV character's profile

** Return to Scene

After checking the character info:
1. Press ~C-c &~ (org-mark-ring-goto)
2. You're back at your scene!

*Workflow*: Writing scene → need to check eye color → ~C-c C-o~ → see profile → ~C-c &~ → back to writing. Takes 3 seconds!

* Searching for Character Appearances

Find all scenes featuring a specific character!

** Step 1: Open Search Menu

Press ~F8 F8~ (main Hydra menu)

Look at the "Search" section:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
^Search^
_1_: POV
_2_: Character
_3_: Plot
_4_: Location
_5_: TODOs
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Step 2: Search by Character

Press ~2~ (for "Character")

** Step 3: Enter Character Name

You'll be prompted:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Character:
#+END_EXAMPLE

Type the character name (e.g., "Alex") and press Enter.

** Step 4: See Results

A buffer opens showing all scenes where Alex appears (either as PoV or in Characters property):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Org QL Search: Character "Alex"

** Scene 1 - The Alarm Goes Off
   :PoV: Alex Rivera

** Scene 2 - Coffee Shop Encounter
   :Characters: Alex Rivera, Sam Chen

** Scene 5 - The Decision
   :PoV: Alex Rivera
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Click any scene* to jump to it!

** Other Character Searches

*Search by PoV only* (~F8 F8 1~):
- Find all scenes from Alex's perspective
- Useful for checking PoV balance in multi-PoV stories

*The difference*:
- Search "1" (PoV): Only scenes where Alex is the viewpoint
- Search "2" (Character): All scenes where Alex appears (PoV or not)

* Character Timeline Visualization

See which characters appear in which scenes at a glance!

** What is a Character Timeline?

A table showing:
- Rows: Your scenes (in story order)
- Columns: Your characters
- Symbols: ◆ (PoV character) or ● (appears in scene)

Example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Scene                  | Chapter   | Alex | Sam | Jordan |
|------------------------+-----------+------+-----+--------|
| Scene 1 - Alarm        | Chapter 1 | ◆    |     |        |
| Scene 2 - Coffee Shop  | Chapter 1 | ◆    | ●   |        |
| Scene 3 - Work Meeting | Chapter 1 | ●    |     | ●      |
| Scene 4 - Evening      | Chapter 2 | ◆    | ●   |        |
#+END_EXAMPLE

Reading the table:
- ◆ = This character is the PoV
- ● = This character appears (but isn't PoV)
- (blank) = Character doesn't appear

** Generating Character Timeline

*** Step 1: Find the Timeline Block

*Short story*: In ~story.org~, scroll to "Character Timeline" section
*Novel*: In ~novel.org~, scroll to "Progress Tracking" or "Character Timeline" section

You'll see:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Character Timeline

#+BEGIN: character-timeline
#+END:
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Step 2: Generate Timeline

1. Put cursor on the ~#+BEGIN: character-timeline~ line
2. Press ~C-c C-c~
3. The table generates automatically!

** Using the Timeline

*What to look for*:

1. *Character coverage*: Do main characters appear regularly?
2. *PoV distribution*: Is PoV balanced (if multi-PoV)?
3. *Forgotten characters*: Any character with only one ●?
4. *Gap detection*: Long stretches without a character?
5. *Relationship tracking*: When do two characters share scenes?

*Example insights*:
- "Jordan only appears in one scene - should I cut them or develop more?"
- "Alex hasn't been PoV in 5 scenes - time to shift perspective!"
- "Sam appears in every scene - am I overusing this character?"

* Practical Exercise (20 minutes)

Let's practice the complete character workflow!

** Exercise: Create Three Characters and Link Them

*** Part 1: Create Characters (10 minutes)

1. *Create protagonist*:
   - ~F8 F8 h~ (capture character)
   - Enter name, fill prompts
   - Fill minimum profile (5 minutes)

2. *Create supporting character*:
   - ~F8 F8 h~
   - Different role (Supporting)
   - Quick profile (3 minutes)

3. *Create minor character*:
   - ~F8 F8 h~
   - Role: Minor
   - Bare minimum info (2 minutes)

*** Part 2: Link to Scenes (5 minutes)

1. *Open manuscript*
2. *Go to first scene*:
   - ~F8 F8 C p~ (set PoV to protagonist)

3. *Go to second scene*:
   - ~F8 F8 C p~ (set PoV)
   - ~F8 F8 C c~ (set scene characters to multiple)

4. *Go to third scene*:
   - Link different characters

*** Part 3: Test Navigation and Search (5 minutes)

1. *Jump to profile*:
   - Cursor on character link
   - ~C-c C-o~ (open)
   - ~C-c &~ (return)

2. *Search for character*:
   - ~F8 F8 2~ (search by character)
   - Enter protagonist's name
   - See all their scenes!

3. *Generate timeline*:
   - Find character timeline section
   - ~C-c C-c~ on the block
   - See your character appearances visualized!

* Integrating Characters into Daily Workflow

How to use character features while writing:

** During Planning (Before Writing)

1. Create character profiles (even minimal ones)
2. Fill GMC (goal, motivation, conflict)
3. Plan character arcs (initial → final state)
4. Note key relationships

** While Drafting

1. Insert scene (~F8 F8 s~)
2. Set PoV (~F8 F8 C p~) - quick menu selection!
3. Set characters (~F8 F8 C c~) - multi-select!
4. Write scene
5. Jump to profile if needed (~C-c C-o~)
6. Return and continue writing (~C-c &~)

** During Revision

1. Search for character (~F8 F8 2~)
2. Review all their scenes
3. Check arc consistency
4. Update character profile with new insights
5. Generate character timeline
6. Look for gaps or overuse
7. Ensure all main characters appear regularly

* Common Questions

** "Do I need profiles for every character?"

*No!* Priority levels:

- *Protagonist(s)*: Full detailed profiles
- *Antagonist*: Full profile
- *Major supporting*: Medium profiles (main sections filled)
- *Minor supporting*: Minimal (name, role, main trait)
- *Background characters*: No profile needed (waiter, clerk, etc.)

** "Can I link plain text character names later?"

*Yes!* The package includes batch conversion:

- ~F8 F8 C L~ (capital L) links all scenes automatically
- Scans your manuscript for character names
- Converts plain text to ID links
- One command, entire manuscript updated

** TODO "What if I change a character's name?"
*NOTE:* Point 4 doesn't happen automatically.

*Easy!*

1. Go to character profile
2. Change the heading (the name)
3. ID links still work (they use the ID, not the name!)
4. (*NO*) All scenes automatically show new name

*No need to update each scene manually!*

** "Can I have multiple PoV characters?"

*Yes!* Common patterns:

- *Single PoV*: One character's perspective throughout
- *Multi-PoV rotating*: Different PoV each scene/chapter
- *Dual PoV*: Two main perspectives
- *Ensemble*: Many PoV characters

Just set ~:PoV:~ to whoever has the perspective in each scene.

** "How do I handle characters without names yet?"

*Strategies*:

1. Use placeholder: "Mysterious Stranger", "The Detective"
2. Use role: "Antagonist", "Love Interest"
3. Use temporary name: "Bob" (change later)
4. Create profile when you know the name

The linking system works regardless!

** "My character list in the menu is empty!"

*Causes*:
1. No characters captured yet (create one!)
2. Characters lack IDs (run ~F8 F8 C i~ to add IDs)
3. Wrong file open (must be in writing project)

*Quick fix*: ~F8 F8 C s~ (setup linking system)

* Troubleshooting

** "Character capture puts character in wrong file"

*Check*:
1. Are you in a writing project? (look for .writing-project file)
2. Is project type detected correctly?
3. For short stories: Does notes.org exist?
4. For novels: Does plan/ directory exist?

*Solution*: Make sure you're in the project directory when capturing.

** "Can't select character from menu - list is empty"

*Causes*:
1. Characters don't have IDs
2. Characters file not formatted correctly

*Solution*:
1. ~F8 F8 C i~ (add IDs to all characters)
2. Make sure characters have ~:Role:~ or ~:TYPE:~ property

** "Link doesn't jump to character profile"

*Check*:
1. Does character profile have ~:ID:~ property?
2. Is ~:ID:~ value unique?
3. Is cursor directly on the link text?

*Solution*:
1. Click directly on character name in the link
2. Or use ~F8 F8 C j~ to jump to PoV character

** "Character timeline shows no characters"

*Causes*:
1. Scenes don't have ~:PoV:~ or ~:Characters:~ properties set
2. Properties have plain text instead of ID links
3. Need to update the dynamic block

*Solution*:
1. Set character properties in scenes (~F8 F8 C p~ and ~F8 F8 C c~)
2. Update table (~C-c C-c~ on #+BEGIN line)

** "Character profile template is incomplete"

*If capture template looks wrong*:

1. Make sure emacs-writing is up to date
2. Try ~M-x org-scribe/capture-character~ directly
3. Check that capture finalized (~C-c C-c~)

* What You've Learned

Excellent work! You've completed Lesson 4. You now know:

✓ Why character profiles matter (consistency, reference, tracking)
✓ Where characters are stored (notes.org vs plan/characters.org)
✓ How to capture characters (~F8 F8 h~)
✓ All sections of the character template (physical, personality, GMC, arc, etc.)
✓ What minimum vs. full profiles contain

✓ How to set PoV character (~F8 F8 C p~)
✓ How to set scene characters (~F8 F8 C c~)
✓ How to jump to character profiles (~C-c C-o~)
✓ How to search for all scenes with a character (~F8 F8 2~)
✓ How to generate character timelines (C-c C-c on block)
✓ How to integrate characters into your daily workflow

* Tips for Character Success

1. *Start minimal* - Don't spend hours on profiles before writing
2. *Develop while writing* - Add details as characters reveal themselves
3. *Use GMC* - Goal, Motivation, Conflict is the minimum for strong characters
4. *Link always* - Use the menu (~F8 F8 C p~) instead of typing names
5. *Check consistency* - Jump to profiles when describing characters
6. *Track appearances* - Use timeline to ensure balanced screen time
7. *Revise profiles* - Update after drafting when you know characters better
8. *Distinguish voices* - Use Notes section for speech patterns/catchphrases
9. *Plan relationships* - Note how characters see each other
10. *Search often* - Review all scenes for a character during revision

** Remember

*Your characters are your story's heart.* The time you invest in understanding them - even with minimal profiles - will make your story richer, more consistent, and more emotionally resonant!
