#+TITLE: Lesson 13: Daily Writing Workflow
#+AUTHOR: Javier Castilla
#+DATE: 2025-11-16
#+STARTUP: overview

* Welcome to Lesson 13!

You've learned all the individual features of ~emacs-writing~. Now it's time to tie everything together into a cohesive daily workflow that maximizes your productivity and creativity.

A good workflow is like a well-worn path through the forest - it gets you where you need to go efficiently, letting you focus on the journey (your writing) rather than navigation (the tools). This lesson shows you how to establish that path.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have:
- A structured morning routine to start your writing session
- An efficient active writing workflow with minimal friction
- An evening routine for tracking progress and planning
- A weekly review process for big-picture perspective
- Workflow variations for different writing styles
- Strategies to maintain consistency

*Estimated time*: 15-20 minutes

* Before You Begin

** What You Need

✓ A writing project you're actively working on
✓ Completion of Lessons 1-12 (or at least familiarity with the features)
✓ 30-60 minutes available for a full writing session
✓ Willingness to experiment and adjust to your preferences

** Philosophy: Your Workflow is Personal

The workflow presented here is a *recommended starting point*, not a rigid prescription. Every writer is different:

- Some write in the morning, others at night
- Some plan extensively, others discover while writing
- Some write in long sessions, others in short bursts
- Some need silence, others need music

Use this lesson to find *your* optimal workflow, not to force yourself into someone else's pattern.

** The Core Principle: Minimize Friction

A good workflow removes obstacles between you and your writing:
- ✓ Reduces decision fatigue (what do I do next?)
- ✓ Automates repetitive tasks
- ✓ Maintains focus and flow
- ✓ Provides regular feedback (progress tracking)
- ✓ Feels natural, not forced

If part of this workflow feels awkward, skip it! The best workflow is the one you actually use.

* The Three-Phase Daily Workflow

Your writing day has three distinct phases:

** Phase 1: Morning (Setup) - 5 minutes

*Goal*: Prepare your environment and mindset for writing.

*Activities*:
- Open your project
- Review yesterday's progress
- Set today's goal
- Activate writing mode

** Phase 2: Active Writing - 30-120 minutes

*Goal*: Write with minimal interruptions.

*Activities*:
- Write scenes
- Quick captures (characters, locations, notes)
- Occasional lookups (dictionary, synonyms)
- Stay in flow

** Phase 3: Evening (Wrap-up) - 10 minutes

*Goal*: Track progress, plan tomorrow, feel accomplished.

*Activities*:
- Count words
- Update tracking tables
- Review what you wrote
- Plan next session
- Backup/commit

Let's explore each phase in detail.

* Phase 1: Morning Setup (5 Minutes)

The morning routine prepares you mentally and technically for writing.

** Step 1: Open Your Project (30 seconds)

Start Emacs and open your manuscript:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Quick method
emacs ~/writing/my-novel/novel.org

# Or from within Emacs
C-x C-f ~/writing/my-novel/novel.org
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Tip*: Create a shell alias or Emacs bookmark for one-keystroke access:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias write="emacs ~/writing/my-novel/novel.org &"
#+END_SRC

Now typing `write` in your terminal opens your manuscript instantly!

** Step 2: Review Yesterday's Work (2 minutes)

Reconnect with your story:

1. Open your manuscript (~novel.org~ or ~story.org~)
2. Navigate to the last scene you wrote:
   - Press ~C-s~ and search for "TODO" or your last heading
   - Or jump to the end: ~M->~
3. Read the last 1-2 paragraphs you wrote
4. Recall where you were going with this scene

*Why this matters*:
- Refreshes your memory of the narrative
- Triggers creative continuation
- Identifies any notes you left yourself
- Gets you emotionally back into the story

** Step 3: Check Progress (1 minute)

See where you stand:

1. Open your statistics file (~statistics.org~ for novels, or tracking section in ~story.org~ for short stories)
2. Look at your progress table
3. Note your current total word count
4. See how close you are to your milestone

Example progress table you might see:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Section   | Words | Goal  | Progress |
|-----------+-------+-------+----------|
| Act I     | 12500 | 15000 | 83%      |
| Act II    | 3400  | 20000 | 17%      |
| Act III   | 0     | 15000 | 0%       |
|-----------+-------+-------+----------|
| Total     | 15900 | 50000 | 32%      |
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Motivational boost*: "I'm at 32%! Almost a third done!"

** Step 4: Set Today's Goal (30 seconds)

Decide what you'll accomplish today:

*Option A - Word Count Goal*:
"I'll write 500 words today."

*Option B - Scene Goal*:
"I'll finish the coffee shop scene."

*Option C - Time Goal*:
"I'll write for 1 hour without stopping."

*Write it down* somewhere visible (a sticky note, a comment in your file, or a dedicated TODO):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# At the top of your manuscript
# TODO: Today's goal: Finish Scene 3 and start Scene 4 (500 words)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Step 5: Activate Writing Mode (30 seconds)

Enter your preferred distraction-free environment:

Press ~F8 F8~ then ~m~ (for distraction-free writing mode)

Your screen transforms:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Before:                          After:
┌──────────────────────┐        ┌──────────────────────┐
│ Menu Bar             │        │                      │
│ Tool Bar             │        │                      │
├──────────────────────┤        │                      │
│ Your manuscript      │   →    │  Your manuscript     │
│                      │        │  (centered, clean)   │
│                      │        │                      │
├──────────────────────┤        │                      │
│ Mode line            │        │                      │
│ Minibuffer           │        │                      │
└──────────────────────┘        └──────────────────────┘
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Alternative modes*:
- Focus mode (~F8 F8~ then ~f~) - Current scene only
- Project mode (~F8 F8~ then ~j~) - With navigation panel
- Normal mode - No special environment

Choose what helps you concentrate best!

** Quick Morning Checklist

□ Open manuscript
□ Read last 2 paragraphs written
□ Check progress table
□ Set today's goal
□ Activate writing mode

*Total time: 5 minutes*

Now you're ready to write!

* Phase 2: Active Writing (30-120 Minutes)

This is where the magic happens. Your goal: stay in flow and minimize interruptions.

** The Golden Rule: Don't Break Flow

During active writing:
- ✓ Write continuously
- ✓ Accept imperfect first drafts
- ✗ Don't edit what you wrote yesterday
- ✗ Don't research extensively
- ✗ Don't check email/social media

Think of this as "creative mode" - editing comes later.

** Core Writing Loop

Your main activity is simple:

1. *Write narrative text*
   - Focus on the current scene
   - Let the words flow
   - Don't self-edit (yet)
   - Trust your revision process

2. *Finish scene*
   - Reach a natural stopping point
   - Leave a note if you know what comes next

3. *Insert next scene* (~F8 F8~ then ~s~)
   - Use the scene template
   - Fill in quick properties (PoV, Location)
   - Start writing immediately

4. *Repeat*

** Quick Captures: Your Flow Preservers

When inspiration strikes mid-writing, capture it quickly without leaving your manuscript:

*** Character Idea

You're writing and think: "Sam needs a sister!"

*Don't stop writing.* Just press ~F8 F8~ then ~h~:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Capture character template appears:

** Sarah Chen
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Secondary
:NAME: Sarah Chen
:AGE: 28
:ROLE: Sam's older sister
:PHYSICAL: [fill later]
:PERSONALITY: Protective, lawyer
:END:

Quick description: Sam's sister, will appear in courthouse scene
#+END_EXAMPLE

Fill in the minimum (name, role), save (~C-c C-c~), and you're back to writing.

*Time elapsed: 30 seconds*

*** Location Note

You're writing a scene in a coffee shop and realize you need more details:

Press ~F8 F8~ then ~l~:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Downtown Coffee Shop
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Secondary
:NAME: Downtown Coffee Shop
:END:

Interior: Check local coffee shops for authentic details - need to describe the espresso machine, wall art, seating arrangement
#+END_EXAMPLE

Save (~C-c C-c~) - back to writing.

*Details can wait for research phase!*

*** Plot Idea

Mid-scene, you realize: "The mysterious package should contain her mother's old letters!"

Press ~F8 F8~ then ~n~ (general note):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Plot: Package Contents
   :PROPERTIES:
   :END:

The package Sam receives in chapter 3 should contain letters from Alex's mother, written before she died. This ties into the mystery subplot.

TODO: Revise chapter 2 to foreshadow the mother's letters
#+END_EXAMPLE

Captured! Now keep writing the current scene.

*** Timeline Entry

"Wait, what day is this scene happening?"

Press ~F8 F8~ then ~t~:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Tuesday Morning - Coffee Shop Meeting
   :PROPERTIES:
   :DATE: Day 3 of the story
   :END:

This is 2 days after the opening scene. Alex has been avoiding the office.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Noted. Continue writing.

** Strategic Lookups: When to Use Language Tools

During active writing, minimize lookups. But sometimes you need the right word *now*.

*** When to Look Up Words

*DO look up* during writing:
- The exact word is on the tip of your tongue
- You're choosing between two similar words
- A wrong word will confuse the reader later

*DON'T look up* during writing:
- Minor word choice improvements (fix in revision)
- Extensive research (mark with [CHECK] and continue)
- Perfect synonyms (get close enough, polish later)

*** Quick Lookup Pattern

When you must look up a word:

1. Type the approximate word: "She felt melancholic"
2. Press ~F8 F8~ then ~d~ (dictionary)
3. Read definition quickly: "Yes, that's right"
4. Close lookup buffer: ~q~
5. Continue writing

*Time: 15 seconds*

If you're not sure: "She felt melancholic [CHECK - or use different word?]" and keep going.

** Managing TODO Markers

As you write, leave breadcrumbs for revision:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Alex walked into the coffee shop. [CHECK: Is it raining? Continuity.]

She saw Sam sitting in the corner booth. [TODO: Describe Sam's expression -
nervous? eager? What emotion sets up the conflict?]

"I found something," Sam said, sliding the envelope across the table.
[RESEARCH: What do old letters look like when they've been stored for 20 years?]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Markers to use:
- `[CHECK]` - Verify continuity or facts
- `[TODO]` - Something to add/expand
- `[RESEARCH]` - Need factual information
- `[REVISE]` - This section needs rewriting

These are gifts to your future editing self!

** The Pomodoro Integration

Many writers use the Pomodoro Technique (25 minutes writing, 5 minutes break):

*Writing block (25 min)*:
1. Start timer
2. Write continuously
3. Do quick captures only
4. When timer rings, finish your sentence

*Break (5 min)*:
- Stand up, stretch
- Refill water/coffee
- Don't check social media (breaks flow)
- Think about next scene

*After 4 pomodoros*: Take a longer break (15-30 min)

*Emacs Pomodoro*: Install ~org-pomodoro~ package for built-in timer

** Dealing with Stuck Moments

You're mid-scene and don't know what happens next:

*Option 1 - Skip Ahead*:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[SCENE INCOMPLETE - Pick up after the confrontation]

*** Next Scene - The Aftermath
#+END_EXAMPLE

Write what you *do* know, then return to the gap.

*Option 2 - Write Terribly*:
Give yourself permission to write badly. You can fix it later:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Sam tells Alex about the thing. [This is terrible dialogue, fix later]
Alex reacts with surprise. [Describe this better in revision]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Bad writing is better than no writing. Revision fixes everything.

*Option 3 - Quick Outline*:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
# Outline for rest of scene:
# - Sam reveals the secret about the letters
# - Alex doesn't believe her at first
# - Sam shows proof
# - Alex realizes her whole understanding was wrong
# - Scene ends with Alex leaving abruptly

[Write the actual scene later]
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then move to the next scene you're excited about.

** Active Writing Checklist

During your session:

□ Write continuously
□ Use quick captures for ideas (~F8 F8~ + ~h~/~l~/~n~/~t~)
□ Minimal lookups - mark [CHECK] instead
□ Leave TODO markers for revision
□ Don't edit yesterday's work
□ Take short breaks (5 min per hour)
□ Stop when you reach your goal OR time limit

*Remember*: Momentum matters more than perfection!

* Phase 3: Evening Wrap-Up (10 Minutes)

End your session with a sense of accomplishment and preparation for tomorrow.

** Step 1: Count Your Words (1 minute)

See what you achieved today!

1. Position cursor on today's section (the heading for the chapter or scene you worked on)
2. Press ~F8 F8~ then ~w~ (word count)
3. Read the result: "Subtree 'Chapter 3': 1,247 words"

*Celebration moment*: You wrote over 1,000 words today!

** Step 2: Update Tracking Tables (2 minutes)

1. Open ~statistics.org~ (novels) or your story file (short stories)
2. Navigate to the word count table
3. Position cursor in the table
4. Press ~C-c C-c~ to update

The table recalculates:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Before:                         After:
| Total | 15900 | 50000 | 32% | → | Total | 17147 | 50000 | 34% |
#+END_EXAMPLE

You went from 32% to 34% - progress!

** Step 3: Update Daily Tracking (2 minutes)

If using org-tracktable for daily logs:

1. Navigate to your daily tracking table
2. Add today's entry:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Date       | Words | Total | Scene              |
|------------+-------+-------+--------------------|
| 2025-11-15 | 823   | 15900 | Chapter 3, Scene 1 |
| 2025-11-16 | 1247  | 17147 | Chapter 3, Scene 2 | ← Today!
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Streak tracking*: "That's 7 days in a row!"

** Step 4: Review and Plan (3 minutes)

1. *Quick review*:
   - Scroll through today's writing
   - Don't edit (resist the urge!)
   - Just read and appreciate
   - Note any major issues for revision

2. *Leave a note for tomorrow*:
   At the end of your last scene:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   [Stopped here on 2025-11-16. Next: Sam reveals the truth about
   the letters. Alex's reaction should be disbelief first, then slowly
   accepting. Good emotional tension. Remember to show, not tell.]
   #+END_EXAMPLE

3. *Plan tomorrow's session*:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   # Tomorrow: Finish Scene 2, start Scene 3 (confrontation)
   # Goal: 500 words minimum
   #+END_EXAMPLE

- *Pace*: "At this rate, I'll finish in 8 weeks"

*** 2. Check Character Timeline (5 minutes)

Open your manuscript and update the character timeline:

1. Navigate to the Character Timeline section
2. Position on the dynamic block: `#+BEGIN: character-timeline`
3. Press ~C-c C-c~ to regenerate

Review the table:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

* Common Workflow Challenges

** Challenge 1: "I can't maintain consistency"

*Solutions*:
- Lower your daily goal (100 words is fine!)
- Write at the same time every day (builds habit)
- Track your streak (don't break the chain)
- Remove friction (one-click project opening)
- Forgive missed days (restart tomorrow)

** Challenge 2: "I spend too much time planning/organizing"

*Solutions*:
- Set a timer for planning (max 5 minutes)
- Skip morning review sometimes
- Do captures AFTER writing session
- Remember: Organized notes don't write the book

** Challenge 3: "I keep editing yesterday's work"

*Solutions*:
- Use ~F8 F8 f~ (focus mode) - only see current scene
- Jump to end immediately (~M->~)
- Set a rule: No scrolling up!
- Start each session with new scene
- Save editing for designated revision time

** Challenge 4: "I get distracted by research"

*Solutions*:
- Mark [RESEARCH] and keep writing
- Set research time separate from writing time
- Use placeholder text: "She used a [TOOL NAME]"
- Remember: Fiction doesn't need perfect accuracy

** Challenge 5: "Progress tracking feels demotivating"

*Solutions*:
- Track words written (not % of goal)
- Celebrate small wins (any writing is good!)
- Use time-based goals instead of word count
- Skip tracking if it hurts more than helps
- Remember: Every writer's pace is different

** Challenge 6: "The workflow feels too rigid"

*Solutions*:
- Pick only the steps that work for you
- Modify the workflow to fit your style
- Some days, skip the whole workflow - just write!
- Workflows serve you, not the other way around

* Building Your Personal Workflow

Let's design your custom workflow.

** Exercise: Your Ideal Writing Day

Imagine your perfect writing day. Answer these questions:

1. *What time do I write best?*
   - Early morning / Midday / Evening / Late night

2. *How long can I focus?*
   - 20-30 min / 1 hour / 2+ hours / All day

3. *How much planning do I need?*
   - None (pantser) / Some / Detailed (plotter)

4. *What's my realistic daily goal?*
   - 100-250 words / 250-500 / 500-1000 / 1000+

5. *What motivates me?*
   - Word count / Finished scenes / Time spent / Streak

6. *What derails me?*
   - Editing / Research / Social media / Self-doubt

** The Core Workflow at a Glance

| Phase   | Time   | Key Activities                                    |
|---------+--------+---------------------------------------------------|

3. *Separate Creation from Editing*: Write now, fix later
4. *Track Progress*: What gets measured gets improved
5. *Celebrate Wins*: Acknowledge every writing session
