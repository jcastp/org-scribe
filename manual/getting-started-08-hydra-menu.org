#+TITLE: Lesson 8: The Hydra Menu
#+AUTHOR: Javier Castilla
#+DATE: 2025-11-16
#+STARTUP: overview

* Welcome to Lesson 8!

By now you've used the Hydra menu many times throughout the previous lessons. You've pressed ~F8 F8~ to insert scenes, count words, search for characters, and more. But you might not fully understand how the menu is organized or what all those options do.

In this lesson, we'll take a comprehensive tour of the Hydra menu - your command center for all ~emacs-writing~ features.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have:
- Mastered opening and navigating the Hydra menu
- Understood the six functional categories
- Learned keyboard shortcuts for your most-used features
- Discovered features you didn't know existed
- Customized the menu keybinding to your preference

*Estimated time*: 10-15 minutes

* Before You Begin

** What You Need

✓ A writing project open (any project from previous lessons)
✓ Basic familiarity with the Hydra menu from previous lessons
✓ Curiosity about what other features are available!

** Quick Check

Can you open the Hydra menu?

1. Press ~F8~ once
2. Press ~F8~ again
3. You should see the menu appear

If you see the menu, you're ready! If not, make sure ~emacs-writing-mode~ is active.

* What is the Hydra Menu?

** The Problem It Solves

~emacs-writing~ has dozens of features:
- Insert scenes and chapters
- Activate different writing modes
- Capture characters, locations, plots
- Count words and track progress
- Search by character, plot, location, PoV
- Manage ID-based links

*How do you remember all those commands?*

You don't need to! The Hydra menu provides a visual, organized interface to all features.

** Hydra: Sticky Menus

The menu is called a "Hydra" because:
- It shows available options visually
- You press single keys to activate features (no M-x needed)
- Multiple related actions are grouped together
- Submenus are available for complex features
- The menu stays open until you quit or execute a command

*Think of it as a quick-access toolbar* - but keyboard-driven!

* Opening the Hydra Menu

** The Default Keybinding

Press: ~F8 F8~ (F8 twice)

*Why F8 twice?*
- F8 is easy to reach
- Double-tap prevents accidental activation
- Consistent with other Emacs conventions (like C-c C-c)

** What You'll See

When you open the menu, you'll see:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
^Insert^           ^Modes^            ^Capture^          ^Tools^            ^Search^           ^Manage^
^^^^^^^^------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
_s_: Scene         _m_: Mode (write)  _n_: Note          _w_: Words count   _1_: POV           _C_: Characters

_o_: Open file     _f_: Focus mode    _l_: Location      _a_: Add WC props  _3_: Plot          _P_: Plot threads
                 _e_: Editing mode  _b_: oBject        _d_: Dictionary    _4_: Location
                                  _t_: Timeline      _y_: sYnonyms      _5_: TODOs
                                                                                     _q_: Quit
#+END_EXAMPLE

This is your command center!

** Understanding the Layout

The menu is organized into *six columns*:

1. *Insert* - Add content (scenes, chapters)
2. *Modes* - Change writing environment
3. *Capture* - Quick entry for planning data
4. *Tools* - Word counting and utilities
5. *Search* - Find scenes by properties
6. *Manage* - Link management (advanced)

Each column groups related functions together.

* The Six Functional Categories

Let's explore each category in detail.

** Column 1: Insert

*Purpose*: Add new content to your manuscript

| Key | Command      | What It Does                          |
|-----+--------------+---------------------------------------|
| ~s~   | Scene        | Insert a new scene with template      |
| ~c~   | Chapter      | Insert a new chapter with template    |
| ~o~   | Open file    | Quick navigation to project files     |

*When to use*:
- Starting a new scene (~s~)
- Beginning a new chapter (~c~)
- Switching between project files (~o~)

*Most frequent*: ~s~ (scene) - you'll use this constantly!

** Column 2: Modes

*Purpose*: Change your writing environment for different tasks

| Key | Command         | What It Does                              |
|-----+-----------------+-------------------------------------------|
| ~m~   | Mode (write)    | Distraction-free writing mode             |
| ~p~   | Project mode    | Show project navigation panels            |
| ~f~   | Focus mode      | Focus on current section (narrow)         |
| ~e~   | Editing mode    | Three-panel editing layout                |

*When to use*:
- Starting writing session → ~m~ (distraction-free)
- Need outline view → ~p~ (project mode with treemacs)
- Revising one scene → ~f~ (focus mode)
- Editing with notes → ~e~ (editing mode)

*Most frequent*: ~m~ (writing mode) for daily writing

*Tip*: Modes are mutually exclusive - activating one exits the others

** Column 3: Capture

*Purpose*: Quickly add planning information without leaving your manuscript

| Key | Command   | What It Does                                  |
|-----+-----------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~n~   | Note      | Capture a general note                        |
| ~h~   | cHaracter | Add a new character profile                   |
| ~l~   | Location  | Add a new location/setting                    |
| ~b~   | oBject    | Add an important object (MacGuffin, artifact) |
| ~t~   | Timeline  | Add a timeline event                          |

*When to use*:
- Mid-writing, capture a character → ~h~
- Need to define a new location → ~l~
- Tracking an important object → ~b~
- Recording story timeline → ~t~
- Quick idea you don't want to forget → ~n~

*Most frequent*: ~h~ (character) and ~l~ (location)

*Why "cHaracter" and "oBject"?*
- The letter ~c~ was already taken (Chapter)
- The letter ~o~ was already taken (Open file)
- Hydra uses the uppercase letter in the name as a hint

** Column 4: Tools

*Purpose*: Writing utilities and reference tools

| Key | Command        | What It Does                                 |
|-----+----------------+----------------------------------------------|
| ~w~   | Words count    | Count words in current section               |
| ~r~   | tRack table    | Update progress tracking tables              |
| ~a~   | Add WC props   | Add/update :WORDCOUNT: property              |
| ~d~   | Dictionary     | Look up word in RAE dictionary (Spanish)     |
| ~y~   | sYnonyms       | Find synonyms (Spanish/English)              |

*When to use*:
- After writing → ~w~ (check word count)
- End of session → ~a~ (store word count)
- Update progress table → ~r~
- Writing in Spanish, need definition → ~d~
- Need better word → ~y~ (synonyms)

*Most frequent*: ~w~ (count), ~a~ (add properties), ~r~ (track)

*Language note*: Dictionary and synonyms work best for Spanish, but synonyms supports English too

** Column 5: Search

*Purpose*: Find scenes by properties (character, plot, location, PoV)

| Key | Command   | What It Does                             |
|-----+-----------+------------------------------------------|
| ~1~   | POV       | Find all scenes from a character's PoV   |
| ~2~   | Character | Find all scenes featuring a character    |
| ~3~   | Plot      | Find all scenes in a plot thread         |
| ~4~   | Location  | Find all scenes in a location            |
| ~5~   | TODOs     | Find all TODO items in project           |

*When to use*:
- "Where did Alex appear?" → ~2~ (character search)
- "Which scenes have Alex's PoV?" → ~1~ (PoV search)
- "Where's the romance subplot?" → ~3~ (plot search)
- "All coffee shop scenes?" → ~4~ (location search)
- "What needs fixing?" → ~5~ (TODO search)

*Most frequent*: ~2~ (character) and ~3~ (plot)

*Why numbers?*
- Easy to remember: 1=PoV, 2=Character, 3=Plot, 4=Location, 5=TODOs
- Quick to type
- Consistent ordering

** Column 6: Manage

*Purpose*: Advanced linking features (ID-based links between scenes and planning)

| Key | Command       | What It Does                         |
|-----+---------------+--------------------------------------|
| ~C~   | Characters    | Character linking submenu            |
| ~L~   | Locations     | Location linking submenu             |
| ~P~   | Plot threads  | Plot thread linking submenu          |

*When to use*:
- Setting up character links → ~C~
- Setting up location links → ~L~
- Setting up plot thread links → ~P~
- Generating timelines and reports

*Most frequent*: ~C~ (character linking)

*Note*: These are SUBMENUS - they open additional menus with more options

*Capitals are intentional*:
- Lowercase letters are for main actions
- Uppercase letters open submenus

* Exploring the Submenus

When you press ~C~, ~L~, or ~P~, you enter a submenu with more options.

* Common Usage Patterns

Here are the most frequent Hydra workflows you'll use.

** Daily Writing Session

1. ~F8 F8 m~ - Activate writing mode (distraction-free)
2. Write your scene...
3. ~F8 F8 m~ - Exit writing mode
4. ~F8 F8 w~ - Check word count
5. ~F8 F8 a~ - Add word count to properties

*Muscle memory*: m → write → m → w → a

** Starting a New Scene

1. ~F8 F8 s~ - Insert scene template
2. Fill in scene properties manually OR
3. ~F8 F8 C p~ - Set PoV character (from menu)
4. ~F8 F8 C c~ - Set scene characters (from menu)
5. ~F8 F8 L c~ - Set location (from menu)
6. ~F8 F8 P p~ - Set plot threads (from menu)
7. ~F8 F8 m~ - Start writing!

*Efficient workflow*: s → C p → C c → L c → P p → m

** Tracking Progress

1. ~F8 F8 a~ - Add word count properties to scenes
2. Navigate to progress table
3. ~C-c C-c~ - Update table (not Hydra, regular Org command)
4. ~F8 F8 r~ - Update org-tracktable (if installed)

*Quick check*: a → navigate → C-c C-c

** Finding Character Scenes

1. ~F8 F8 2~ - Search by character
2. Select character from list
3. Review results
4. ~C-c C-o~ - Jump to a scene
5. ~C-c &~ - Return from jump

*Navigation*: 2 → select → C-c C-o → C-c &

** Looking Up a Word (Spanish Writers)

1. Place cursor on word
2. ~F8 F8 d~ - RAE dictionary lookup
3. Read definition
4. OR ~F8 F8 y~ - Find synonyms
5. Choose better word

*Language tools*: d (definition) or y (synonyms)

* Practical Exercise (10 minutes)

Let's practice using the Hydra menu systematically.

** Exercise 1: Menu Exploration

1. *Open Hydra*: ~F8 F8~
2. *Look at each column* - don't press anything yet
3. *Identify*:
   - Which key inserts a scene? (s)
   - Which key activates writing mode? (m)
   - Which key captures a character? (h)
   - Which key counts words? (w)
   - Which key searches by plot? (3)
   - Which key opens character linking? (C)
4. *Press* ~q~ to quit without executing anything

** Exercise 2: Navigation Practice

1. *Open Hydra*: ~F8 F8~
2. *Enter character submenu*: ~C~
3. *Look at options* - which key sets PoV? (p)
4. *Return to main*: ~q~
5. *Enter location submenu*: ~L~
6. *Return to main*: ~q~
7. *Enter plot submenu*: ~P~
8. *Notice analysis options* - what does ~r~ do? (health report)
9. *Return to main*: ~q~
10. *Quit Hydra*: ~q~

** Exercise 3: Common Actions

1. *Insert a scene*: ~F8 F8 s~
2. *Set PoV character*: ~F8 F8 C p~ → select character
3. *Count words*: ~F8 F8 w~
4. *Search for a character*: ~F8 F8 2~ → select character
5. *Capture a quick note*: ~F8 F8 n~ → write note → complete capture

** Exercise 4: Build Muscle Memory

Repeat this sequence 3 times without looking at notes:

1. ~F8 F8~ (open)
2. ~m~ (writing mode)
3. ~F8 F8~ (open again)
4. ~m~ (exit writing mode)
5. ~F8 F8~ (open)
6. ~w~ (count words)

*Goal*: Make "F8 F8" + single letter feel natural

* Customizing the Hydra Keybinding

The default keybinding is ~F8 F8~, but you can change it.

** Why Customize?

Reasons to change:
- F8 conflicts with other packages
- You want something faster
- You prefer a specific key combination
- Your keyboard layout makes F8 awkward

** Common Alternative Keybindings

Popular choices:

| Keybinding | Pros                            | Cons                         |
|------------+---------------------------------+------------------------------|
| ~F8 F8~      | Default, unlikely to conflict   | Requires two presses         |
| ~C-c w~      | Fast, single combo              | Might conflict with org      |
| ~C-c C-w~    | Similar to other org commands   | Might conflict               |
| ~s-w~        | Super key, unlikely to conflict | Not all keyboards have Super |
| ~M-W~        | Fast, unlikely to conflict      | Might conflict with packages |
| ~F5~         | Single press, easy to reach     | Often used for other things  |

** How to Change the Keybinding

Add to your Emacs configuration (~init.el~ or ~.emacs~):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Example 1: Use C-c w instead
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c w") 'hydra-org-scribe/body)

;; Example 2: Use F5 instead
(global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'hydra-org-scribe/body)

;; Example 3: Use Super-w (Windows key + w)
(global-set-key (kbd "s-w") 'hydra-org-scribe/body)

;; Example 4: Use C-c C-w
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-w") 'hydra-org-scribe/body)
#+END_SRC

*After adding*:
1. Save your configuration
2. Restart Emacs OR
3. Evaluate the line: ~C-x C-e~ at end of line
4. Test the new keybinding

** Removing the Old Keybinding

If you want to completely replace ~F8 F8~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
;; Remove old binding
(global-unset-key (kbd "<f8> <f8>"))

;; Set new binding
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c w") 'hydra-org-scribe/body)
#+END_SRC

** Recommended Keybinding

If you're unsure, stick with ~F8 F8~:
- ✓ Unlikely to conflict
- ✓ Easy to remember (double-tap)
- ✓ Default in documentation
- ✓ Consistent for all users

Change only if you have a specific reason!

* Tips for Hydra Mastery

** Memory Aids

*Mnemonic patterns*:
- ~s~ = Scene
- ~c~ = Chapter
- ~m~ = Mode
- ~w~ = Words
- ~h~ = cHaracter (c was taken)
- ~l~ = Location
- ~n~ = Note

*Numbers for searches*:
- 1 = First person (PoV)
- 2 = Secondary character search
- 3 = Third plot search
- 4 = Fourth location search
- 5 = Five TODOs (okay, this one doesn't work...)

*Capitals = Submenus*:
- C = Character submenu
- L = Location submenu
- P = Plot submenu

** Visual Learning

Print this cheat sheet:

HYDRA QUICK REFERENCE (F8 F8)

INSERT     MODES       CAPTURE     TOOLS       SEARCH      MANAGE
s: Scene   m: Write    n: Note     w: Count    1: PoV      C: Chars
c: Chapter p: Project  h: Char     r: Track    2: Char     L: Locs
o: Open    f: Focus    l: Loc      a: Props    3: Plot     P: Plots
           e: Edit     b: Obj      d: Dict     4: Loc
                       t: Time     y: Syn      5: TODO
#+END_EXAMPLE

Tape it near your monitor until you memorize it!

** Practice Deliberately

*Week 1*: Use only Insert and Modes columns
*Week 2*: Add Capture and Tools
*Week 3*: Master Search
*Week 4*: Explore Manage (submenus)

Don't try to learn everything at once!

** Common Mistakes

1. *Forgetting to open Hydra first*
   - Wrong: Just pressing ~m~
   - Right: ~F8 F8~ then ~m~

2. *Confusing columns*
   - Character capture vs. Character search
   - ~h~ (capture new) vs ~2~ (search existing)

3. *Expecting actions to repeat*
   - Hydra closes after one action (by design)
   - Re-open for next action: ~F8 F8~

4. *Not using submenus*
   - Many powerful features are in ~C~, ~L~, ~P~
   - Don't ignore the Manage column!

** Speed Tips

*Fastest workflows*:
- Scene + writing: ~F8 F8 s ... F8 F8 m~
- Quick count: ~F8 F8 w~
- Save count: ~F8 F8 a~
- Character search: ~F8 F8 2~

*Batch operations*:
- Open Hydra once
- Execute action
- Immediately press ~F8 F8~ again for next action
- Build speed through repetition

** Discovering Features

*Try one new feature per week*:
- Week 1: Master ~m~ (writing mode)
- Week 2: Learn ~h~ (character capture)
- Week 3: Try ~2~ (character search)
- Week 4: Explore ~C~ (character linking submenu)
- Week 5: Use ~3~ (plot search)
- Week 6: Try ~P r~ (plot health report)

Gradual exploration prevents overwhelm!

* Troubleshooting

** "F8 F8 doesn't do anything"

*Possible causes*:
1. ~emacs-writing-mode~ not active
   - Check mode line for "Writing"
   - Activate: ~M-x emacs-writing-mode~

2. Keybinding not set
   - Check if Hydra package is installed
   - Verify keybinding: ~C-h k F8 F8~

3. Conflict with another package
   - Try ~M-x hydra-org-scribe/body~ directly
   - Set custom keybinding (see Customization section)

** "Menu appears but keys don't work"

*Check*:
1. Are you pressing the right key?
   - Look at the menu carefully
   - Underscores show the exact letter: ~_s_~

2. Is the function available?
   - Some functions need dependencies
   - Example: ~d~ needs RAE API package

3. Are you in the right context?
   - Some functions only work in manuscript files
   - Some need cursor on specific heading types

** "Submenu doesn't return to main menu"

*Solution*:
- Press ~q~ in submenu to go back
- Press ~Q~ (capital Q) to quit completely
- If stuck, press ~C-g~ to abort Hydra

** "I pressed the wrong key!"

*Don't panic*:
1. Press ~C-g~ to cancel the command
2. Press ~F8 F8~ to re-open Hydra
3. Press the correct key

*No harm done* - most commands are safe to cancel!

** "Menu looks garbled or misaligned"

*Causes*:
1. Terminal width too narrow
   - Resize Emacs window wider
   - Hydra needs ~100 characters width

2. Font size too large
   - Reduce font size: ~C-x C--~
   - Or use ~C-x C-0~ to reset

3. Theme rendering issue
   - Try different theme
   - Or ignore - functionality still works!

** Practice Before Moving On

Reinforce your Hydra skills:

1. *Memorize the six columns*
   - Insert, Modes, Capture, Tools, Search, Manage
   - Close your eyes and recite them

2. *Practice your daily workflow*
   - F8 F8 s (scene)
   - F8 F8 m (write mode)
   - Write 100 words
   - F8 F8 m (exit)
   - F8 F8 w (count)
   - F8 F8 a (save count)

3. *Explore submenus*
   - Visit all three submenus (C, L, P)
   - Try at least one command from each
   - Return to main menu with q

4. *Test search functions*
   - Use all five search options (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
   - See what results look like
   - Navigate to results with C-c C-o

5. *Capture something*
   - Use all five capture options (n, h, l, b, t)
   - Fill out templates completely
   - See where data is stored

Take your time! The Hydra menu is your primary interface to ~emacs-writing~ - mastering it makes everything else easier.

** Memory Tricks

*First letter patterns*:
- ~s~ Scene, ~c~ Chapter, ~m~ Mode, ~w~ Words, ~n~ Note, ~l~ Location

*Numbers are searches*:
- 1-5 all search for different things

*Capitals are submenus*:
- C, L, P open linking menus

*q always means quit*:
- Exit submenu or exit Hydra

** Workflow Patterns

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Daily Writing:
  F8 F8 m → write → F8 F8 m → F8 F8 w → F8 F8 a

New Scene:
  F8 F8 s → F8 F8 C p → F8 F8 C c → F8 F8 m

Progress Check:
  F8 F8 a → navigate → C-c C-c → F8 F8 r

Character Research:
  F8 F8 2 → select → C-c C-o → read → C-c &
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Summary

The Hydra menu is your command center for ~emacs-writing~. Instead of memorizing dozens of command names, you can press ~F8 F8~ and see all available options organized into six clear categories.

The key to mastery is:
1. Understand the six categories
2. Learn your daily workflow keys (s, m, w, a)
3. Gradually explore other features
4. Practice until ~F8 F8~ becomes muscle memory

Don't try to memorize everything at once. Start with the essentials and expand your knowledge as you need new features!
