#+TITLE: Lesson 14: Revision and Editing Workflow
#+AUTHOR: Javier Castilla
#+DATE: 2025-11-16
#+STARTUP: overview

* Welcome to Lesson 14!

You've finished your first draft - congratulations! Now comes the critical work of revision. This is where good writing becomes great writing. Fortunately, ~org-scribe~ provides powerful tools specifically designed for the revision process.

Revision isn't just fixing typos. It's about:
- Finding and fixing inconsistencies
- Strengthening character development
- Ensuring plot threads resolve properly
- Improving pacing and structure
- Polishing prose

This lesson shows you how to use ~org-scribe~'s features to make revision systematic, thorough, and even enjoyable.

By the end of this lesson, you'll have:
- Mastered editing mode for professional revision environment
- Learned to find inconsistencies using search functions
- Used timelines to check character development and plot balance
- Created and managed revision TODO lists systematically
- Developed a complete revision workflow
- Understood multi-pass revision strategies

*Estimated time*: 20-25 minutes

* Before You Begin

** What You Need

✓ A completed first draft (or at least several chapters)
✓ Familiarity with search functions (Lesson 7)
✓ Understanding of timelines (Lesson 10)
✓ Knowledge of editing mode (Lesson 9)
✓ Willingness to be critical of your own work

** The Revision Mindset

Revision requires a different mindset than drafting:

*Drafting mindset*:
- Creative, expansive
- "Yes, and..."
- Don't stop, don't edit
- Generate material

*Revision mindset*:
- Critical, selective
- "Is this necessary?"
- Slow down, examine closely
- Refine material

*Important*: These are different tasks requiring different mental states. Don't try to do both simultaneously!

** Types of Revision

This lesson covers three revision levels:

1. **Structural Revision** (Act/Chapter level) - Plot, pacing, character arcs
2. **Scene Revision** (Scene level) - Individual scenes, dialogue, description
3. **Line Editing** (Sentence level) - Prose polish, word choice, rhythm

We'll focus on how ~org-scribe~ supports each level.

* Setting Up Your Revision Environment

** The Editing Mode Advantage

Editing mode (~F8 F8 e~) creates a professional three-panel layout:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

The first pass is high-level. Don't edit prose yet - focus on big picture.

** Step 1: Review Plot Thread Coverage

Use the plot timeline to verify all threads are developed properly.

1. In your manuscript, navigate to the Plot Timeline section
2. Find the dynamic block: ~#+BEGIN: plot-timeline~
3. Position cursor anywhere in the block
4. Press ~C-c C-c~ to regenerate

You'll see something like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Scene                  | Chapter   | Main Plot | Romance | Mystery |
|------------------------+-----------+-----------+---------+---------|
| Scene 1 - Opening      | Chapter 1 | ●         |         | ●       |
| Scene 2 - Meeting Sam  | Chapter 1 | ●         | ●       |         |
| Scene 3 - Discovery    | Chapter 2 | ●         |         | ●       |
| Scene 4 - Dinner       | Chapter 2 |           | ●       |         |
| Scene 5 - Revelation   | Chapter 3 | ●         | ●       | ●       |
#+END_EXAMPLE

**What to look for**:

*Problem: Long gaps*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Scene 10 - X | Romance | ●       |
| Scene 11 - Y | Romance |         |  ← Gap starts
| Scene 12 - Z | Romance |         |
| Scene 13 - A | Romance |         |
| Scene 14 - B | Romance |         |  ← 4 scenes without romance!
| Scene 15 - C | Romance | ●       |  ← Resumes
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Action*: Add Romance subplot moment in Scene 12 or 13

*Problem: Thread appears once then vanishes*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Scene 2  | Mystery | ●       |  ← Introduced
| Scene 3  | Mystery |         |
| ...
| Scene 15 | Mystery | ●       |  ← Resolved (12 scenes later!)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Action*: Add Mystery clues/developments in middle scenes

*Problem: Imbalanced thread coverage*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Main Plot: 15 scenes ✓
Romance: 8 scenes ✓
Mystery: 3 scenes ✗ (underserved!)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Action*: Elevate Mystery thread or demote it to minor plot

** Recording Structural Issues

In your notes panel (right side), add findings:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Plot Thread Issues

** Romance Subplot
- Gap: Scenes 11-14 (4 scenes without development)
- Fix: Add romantic moment in Scene 12
- Location to add: After coffee shop scene
- Type: Brief exchange showing tension

** Mystery Thread
- Problem: Only 3 scenes total - feels underdeveloped
- Options:
  1. Add 2-3 mystery scenes (more work)
  2. Combine with main plot (cleaner)
  3. Cut mystery entirely (drastic)
- Decision: Option 2 - weave into main plot
- Action: Revise existing scenes to integrate mystery
#+END_EXAMPLE

Don't fix yet - just record!

** Step 2: Check Character Development

Use the character timeline to verify character appearances.

1. Navigate to Character Timeline section
2. Find ~#+BEGIN: character-timeline~
3. Press ~C-c C-c~ to regenerate

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Scene                  | Chapter   | Alex | Sam | Jordan | Sarah |
|------------------------+-----------+------+-----+--------+-------|
| Scene 1 - Opening      | Chapter 1 | ◆    | ●   |        |       |
| Scene 2 - Meeting      | Chapter 1 | ◆    | ●   | ●      |       |
| Scene 3 - Conflict     | Chapter 2 | ◆    |     | ●      | ●     |
| Scene 4 - Discovery    | Chapter 2 | ◆    | ●   |        |       |
#+END_EXAMPLE

**Symbols reminder**:
- ◆ = Point of View character (this scene from their perspective)
- ● = Character present (appears but not PoV)

**What to look for**:

*Problem: Secondary character vanishes*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Scene 1  | Sam | ●       |
| Scene 2  | Sam | ●       |
| Scene 3  | Sam |         |  ← Disappears
| Scene 4  | Sam |         |
| ...
| Scene 12 | Sam | ●       |  ← Reappears suddenly (8 scenes later!)
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Action*: Add Sam appearance or reference in Scene 6 or 7

*Problem: PoV imbalance (multi-PoV novels)*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Alex PoV: 12 scenes ◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆◆
Jordan PoV: 2 scenes ◆◆
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Action*: Add more Jordan PoV scenes, or make Jordan non-PoV

*Problem: Character introduced too late*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
| Scene 1-7  | Sarah |     |  ← Not present
| Scene 8    | Sarah | ●   |  ← Suddenly appears
| Scene 9-15 | Sarah | ●●● |  ← Major role
#+END_EXAMPLE

If Sarah is important, introduce earlier!

*Action*: Add Sarah mention/appearance in Scene 3 or 4

** Recording Character Issues

In notes panel:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Character Development Issues

** Sam (Secondary)
- Problem: Absent Scenes 3-11 (8 scenes!)
- Importance: Major secondary character
- Fix: Add brief appearance in Scene 6
- Type: Phone call or text message reference
- Impact: Minimal (2 paragraphs)

** Jordan (PoV)
- Problem: Only 2 PoV scenes vs. Alex's 12
- Options:
  1. Add 3-4 Jordan PoV scenes
  2. Make Jordan non-PoV (single PoV novel)
- Decision: Option 2 - This is Alex's story
- Action: Convert 2 Jordan scenes to Alex PoV
- Status: [ ] Not done yet

** Sarah (Late Introduction)
- Appears: Scene 8
- Role: Important in Act II & III
- Problem: Feels sudden
- Fix: Foreshadow in Scene 3
- Method: Alex mentions her in dialogue
- Lines needed: 1-2 sentences
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Step 3: Check Scene Distribution

Look at your outline (left panel) for structural balance:

*Chapter 1*:
- Scene 1
- Scene 2
- Scene 3
- Scene 4
- Scene 5  ← 5 scenes

*Chapter 2*:
- Scene 6  ← 1 scene (!!)

*Chapter 3*:
- Scene 7
- Scene 8
- Scene 9  ← 3 scenes

**Problem**: Chapter 2 has only 1 scene - feels short

**Options**:
1. Split Chapter 2 Scene 6 into 2 scenes
2. Move Scene 7 from Chapter 3 to Chapter 2
3. Combine Chapters 2 & 3
4. Chapter 2 is intentionally short (bridge chapter) - keep it

Record in notes:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Structural Issues

** Chapter Balance
- Chapter 1: 5 scenes (good)
- Chapter 2: 1 scene (too short!)
- Chapter 3: 3 scenes (good)

Decision: Move Scene 7 to Chapter 2
Reason: Scene 7 is discovery; logically extends Chapter 2 conflict
Action: [ ] Move heading "Scene 7" under "Chapter 2"
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Step 4: Verify Setups and Payoffs

Search for elements that need resolution:

*Search for Chekhov's Guns*:

Use ~F8 F8~ then ~5~ (TODO search) to find:
- ~[SETUP]~ markers
- ~[FORESHADOW]~ markers
- ~[PAYOFF]~ markers

Example findings:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Scene 3: "Sam mentions the locked box in the attic. [SETUP: Box]"
Scene 7: "Alex hears strange noises from above. [FORESHADOW: Box]"
Scene 12: "Alex opens the box and finds... [PAYOFF: Box]"
#+END_EXAMPLE

**Check**: Every SETUP needs a PAYOFF!

*Manual check list in notes*:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Setups & Payoffs Checklist

** Physical Objects
- [ ] Mother's locket (Setup: Scene 1) → Payoff: ?
- [X] Mysterious package (Setup: Scene 2) → Payoff: Scene 10 ✓
- [ ] Strange phone number (Setup: Scene 5) → Payoff: ?

** Promises to Reader
- [X] Who sent the letters? → Resolved: Scene 12 ✓
- [ ] What happened to Alex's mother? → Not resolved yet!
- [ ] Will Sam betray Alex? → Not addressed!

** Character Goals
- [ ] Alex wants to find truth → Status: Abandoned in Act II?
- [X] Sam needs to protect secret → Status: Revealed Act III ✓
- [ ] Jordan seeks redemption → Status: Unresolved!
#+END_EXAMPLE

Items without checkmarks = Problems to fix!

** Structural Pass Summary

After Pass 1, your notes should have:
- Plot thread gaps identified
- Character appearance issues noted
- Chapter balance problems recorded
- Missing setups/payoffs listed

*Don't fix anything yet* - just gather all issues first!

* Revision Pass 2: Scene-Level Work

Now drill down to individual scenes. This is where editing mode shines!

** Using Editing Mode for Scene Revision

Your workflow:

1. *Left panel*: Click on a scene heading
2. *Center panel*: Scene appears for editing
3. *Right panel*: Read your notes for this scene
4. *Edit in center*: Make improvements
5. *Right panel*: Check off completed tasks
6. *Repeat* for next scene

** Scene Revision Checklist Template

Add this to your notes file for each scene:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** Scene 1 - Opening

**** Opening Hook
- [ ] First sentence grabs attention?
- [ ] Clear genre/tone established?
- [ ] Inciting incident clear?

**** Character
- [ ] PoV character's voice distinct?
- [ ] Motivation clear?
- [ ] Emotional state shown (not told)?

**** Setting
- [ ] Location established quickly?
- [ ] Sensory details present (3+ senses)?
- [ ] Time of day clear?

**** Plot
- [ ] Scene advances plot?
- [ ] Conflict present?
- [ ] Stakes clear?
- [ ] Scene ends with forward momentum?

**** Dialogue
- [ ] Each character sounds different?
- [ ] Dialogue tags necessary? (could cut?)
- [ ] Subtext present?
- [ ] Natural rhythm?

**** Prose

- [ ] Unnecessary words cut?
- [ ] Sentence variety?

**** Technical
- [ ] POV consistent (no head-hopping)?
- [ ] Tense consistent?
- [ ] Timeline consistent with previous scenes?
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Scene Opening Improvements

Search for weak scene openings:

1. In center panel, position on a scene heading
2. Read first paragraph
3. Ask: Does this hook the reader?

*Weak opening example*:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** Scene 5 - The Discovery

Alex woke up. She got out of bed. She went to the bathroom and brushed
her teeth. Then she went downstairs.
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Problems*:
- Boring routine activities
- Weak verbs ("woke up", "went")
- No conflict or tension
- Nothing at stake

*Improved opening*:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** Scene 5 - The Discovery

The scream woke Alex at 3 AM. She bolted upright, heart hammering. Not
again. Not another nightmare about the accident.

Except—the scream hadn't been in her dream.

It came from downstairs.
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Better*:
- Immediate tension (scream)
- Character emotion (fear)
- Mystery (what's downstairs?)
- Forward momentum (reader must continue)

** Strengthening Dialogue

Use dictionary tools for dialogue improvement:

1. Position cursor on dialogue
2. ~F8 F8 d~ (dictionary) - Check word meanings
3. ~F8 F8 y~ (synonyms) - Find better dialogue tags

*Example revision*:

Before:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
"I don't believe you," Alex said.
"It's true," Sam said.
"Prove it," Alex said.
#+END_EXAMPLE

After using synonym lookup:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
"I don't believe you," Alex snapped.
"It's true." Sam's voice was barely a whisper.
Alex leaned forward. "Prove it."
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Improvements*:
- Varied dialogue tags
- Body language added
- Action breaks up dialogue
- More dynamic exchange

** Cutting Unnecessary Scenes

Sometimes the best revision is deletion!

*Scene to cut if*:
- Doesn't advance plot
- Doesn't develop character
- Doesn't reveal information
- Could be summarized in one sentence
- Reader won't miss it

*How to check*:

Ask: "If I delete this scene, what's lost?"

If answer is "Nothing important" → Cut it!

*Process*:
1. In outline (left panel), identify suspect scene
2. In center, read scene critically
3. In notes (right), record decision:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
** Scene 4 - Lunch at Café
- Purpose: Alex and Sam eat lunch
- Advances plot? No
- Character development? Minimal
- New information? No
- Decision: CUT
- Replacement: Brief mention in Scene 5 ("After lunch...")
- Status: [ ] Not cut yet
#+END_EXAMPLE

Mark scene with ~ARCHIVE~ tag to hide it without deleting:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** Scene 4 - Lunch at Café    :ARCHIVE:
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then ~C-c C-x a~ (org-archive-subtree) moves it to archive file.

** Adding Missing Scenes

Sometimes you need to ADD scenes:

*Checklist in notes*:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Scenes to Add

** New Scene: Sam's Backstory
- Insert after: Scene 8
- Purpose: Explain why Sam helps Alex
- PoV: Sam
- Location: Sam's apartment
- Content: Flashback to Sam's sister
- Length: ~800 words
- Status: [ ] Not written

** New Scene: Romantic Tension
- Insert after: Scene 12
- Purpose: Develop romance subplot
- PoV: Alex
- Location: Rooftop
- Content: Conversation under stars
- Length: ~600 words
- Status: [ ] Not written
#+END_EXAMPLE

*To insert*:

1. In center panel, go to insertion point
2. ~F8 F8 s~ (insert scene template)
3. Fill properties from your notes
4. Write the scene
5. Update word count (~F8 F8 w~)
6. Check off in notes panel

** Finding Inconsistencies with Search

Use search functions to catch errors:

*Search by character* (~F8 F8~ then ~2~):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Search for character: Sarah
#+END_EXAMPLE

Results show all Sarah scenes. Check:
- Is she spelled "Sarah" or "Sara" consistently?
- Does her description match across scenes?
- Does her speech pattern stay consistent?

*Search by location* (~F8 F8~ then ~4~):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Search for location: Coffee Shop
#+END_EXAMPLE

Results show all coffee shop scenes. Check:
- Is layout described consistently?
- Same ambient details?
- Same time of day if same visit?

*Recording fixes in notes*:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Inconsistencies Found

** Character Names
- Scene 2: "Sarah" (correct)
- Scene 7: "Sara" (typo!)
- Scene 12: "Sarah" (correct)
- Fix: Change "Sara" to "Sarah" in Scene 7
- Status: [ ] Not fixed

** Location: Coffee Shop
- Scene 1: "...on the corner of Main and 5th"
- Scene 7: "...on the corner of Main and 7th" (error!)
- Fix: Decide which intersection (probably 5th)
- Status: [ ] Not decided
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Scene Pass Summary

After Pass 2, you should have:
- Each scene checked against revision checklist
- Weak openings strengthened
- Dialogue improved
- Unnecessary scenes marked for deletion
- Missing scenes identified and listed
- Inconsistencies cataloged

* Revision Pass 3: Line Editing

The final pass polishes prose at sentence level.

** Line-by-Line Reading

Read slowly, out loud if possible:

1. *Left panel*: Select scene
2. *Center panel*: Read every sentence
3. Mark problems inline:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Alex walked [WEAK VERB: strode? hurried?] to the door and opened it.
Sam was standing [WEAK: stood?] there with a package in his hands
[REDUNDANT: "in his hands" implied]. He was [PASSIVE: "He looked"?]
nervous.
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Common Prose Problems to Fix

*** Weak Verbs

*Find*: Search for "was", "were", "is", "are"

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
C-s was RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

Many instances need stronger verbs:

Before: "She was angry"
After: "She seethed"

Before: "The door was open"
After: "The door hung ajar"

*** Passive Voice

*Find*: Search for "was [verb]ed" pattern

Before: "The letter was opened by Alex"
After: "Alex tore open the letter"

Before: "Dinner was being prepared"
After: "The cook prepared dinner"

*Note*: Sometimes passive voice is correct! Don't automatically change all instances.

*** Filter Words

These create distance between reader and character:

- saw
- heard
- felt
- thought
- realized
- wondered
- seemed
- appeared

*Example*:

Before: "Alex heard the door slam"
After: "The door slammed"

Before: "She felt her heart racing"
After: "Her heart raced"

We're in Alex's PoV - we know she hears/feels these things!

*** Repetition

Use search to find repeated words:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
C-s suddenly RET
(press C-s repeatedly to see all instances)
#+END_EXAMPLE

If "suddenly" appears 15 times in one chapter - cut most of them!

*Tracking in notes*:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Overused Words

** Chapter 1
- "suddenly": 8 times (cut to 2-3)
- "just": 12 times (cut to 3-4)
- "really": 6 times (cut all)

** Chapter 2
- "very": 9 times (replace with stronger adjectives)
- "that": 23 times (try cutting, many unnecessary)
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Using Language Tools in Revision

During line editing, use dictionary tools heavily:

*Finding better words*:

1. Spot weak word: "The house was big"
2. ~F8 F8 y~ (synonyms)
3. Search: "big"
4. Find alternatives: enormous, vast, sprawling, cavernous
5. Pick best fit: "The house sprawled across the lot"

*Checking meanings*:

1. Unsure about word choice: "melancholic"
2. ~F8 F8 d~ (dictionary)
3. Read definition
4. Confirm it's the right emotional tone
5. Keep or change based on nuance

** Rhythm and Pacing

Read sentences aloud:

*Check for*:
- Sentence variety (mix short and long)
- Paragraph length (vary)
- Repetitive structures

*Before (monotonous)*:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Alex walked to the door. She opened it slowly. She saw Sam standing
there. He looked nervous. She asked him what he wanted.
#+END_EXAMPLE

All sentences same length and structure!

*After (varied)*:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Alex approached the door and eased it open. Sam stood there, fidgeting.

"What do you want?" she asked.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Varied sentence structure, better rhythm.

** Final Consistency Check

Create master checklist in notes:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
* Final Consistency Checklist

** Character Details
- [ ] Alex's age consistent (32 throughout)
- [ ] Alex's hair color (dark brown in all scenes)
- [ ] Alex's job title (same everywhere)
- [ ] Sam's eye color (blue, not brown)

** Timeline
- [ ] Day 1: Monday (all references match)
- [ ] Day 2: Tuesday (weather: rainy)
- [ ] Day 3: Wednesday (weather: clearing)
- [ ] Day 4: Thursday (all dated correctly)

** Locations
- [ ] Coffee shop: Main & 5th (not 7th)
- [ ] Alex's apartment: Third floor (not second)
- [ ] Office: Downtown (not midtown)

** Plot Elements
- [ ] Package arrives: Scene 2 (referenced correctly later)
- [ ] Letters revealed: Scene 10 (timeline works)
- [ ] Final confrontation: Scene 15 (all threads resolve)

** Names & Terms
- [ ] "Sarah" spelled consistently (not "Sara")
- [ ] Company name: "TechCorp" (not "TechCo")
- [ ] Device name: "analyzer" (not "analyser" - US spelling)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Work through this systematically!

* Managing Revision TODOs

Org-mode's TODO system is perfect for tracking revision work.

** Setting Up TODO Keywords

Add to top of your manuscript file:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
#+TODO: DRAFT | REVISED POLISHED
#+TODO: FIX EXPAND CUT | DONE
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Marking Scenes with TODO States

As you work through revision:

*Scene not yet revised*:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** DRAFT Scene 1 - Opening
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Scene revised but needs polish*:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** REVISED Scene 2 - Meeting

* Complete Revision Workflow

Here's a systematic approach integrating all tools:

** Week 1: Structural Pass

*Monday*:
1. Open manuscript
2. ~F8 F8 e~ (activate editing mode)

** Week 2-3: Scene-Level Pass

*Daily routine (Mon-Fri)*:

Morning session (1-2 hours):
1. ~F8 F8 e~
2. Select next DRAFT scene (outline panel)
3. Read scene against checklist (notes panel)
4. Identify problems
5. Don't fix yet - just mark issues

Afternoon session (1-2 hours):
1. Return to scenes marked in morning
2. Make edits
3. Strengthen openings
4. Improve dialogue
5. Add sensory details
6. Mark scene as REVISED

Target: 2-3 scenes per day

** Week 4: Line Editing Pass

Full day session (4-6 hours):
1. ~F8 F8 e~
2. Read scene aloud
3. Fix weak verbs
4. Eliminate passive voice
5. Cut filter words
6. Improve rhythm
7. Use ~F8 F8 y~ for synonym lookup
8. Use ~F8 F8 d~ for word verification
9. Mark scene as POLISHED

Target: 3-5 scenes per day

** Week 5: Final Check

*Monday-Tuesday*: Full manuscript read-through
- Read as a reader (not writer)
- Mark remaining issues
- Don't stop to fix (maintain flow)

*Wednesday-Thursday*: Fix issues from read-through
- Work through marked problems
- Final consistency checks
- Update tracking tables

*Friday*: Completion
- Verify all TODO items cleared
- Generate final word count
- Update progress to 100%
- Celebrate!

* Multi-Pass Strategy Examples

Different writers use different revision approaches:

** The Three-Pass Method

*Pass 1 - Macro (1-2 weeks)*:
- Plot structure
- Character arcs
- Pacing
- Major additions/cuts

*Pass 2 - Micro (2-3 weeks)*:
- Scene by scene
- Dialogue
- Description
- Individual paragraphs

*Pass 3 - Polish (1 week)*:
- Sentence level
- Word choice
- Rhythm
- Final cleanup

** The Five-Pass Method

*Pass 1 - Plot*: Story structure only
*Pass 2 - Character*: Character development only
*Pass 3 - Scene*: Scene-level improvements
*Pass 4 - Prose*: Line editing
*Pass 5 - Consistency*: Final cleanup

Each pass = 1 week

** The Chapter-at-a-Time Method

For each chapter:
1. Structural review (1 day)
2. Scene improvements (2-3 days)
3. Line editing (1-2 days)
4. Final check (1 day)

Complete one chapter fully before moving to next.

*Advantage*: Each chapter is fully finished as you go
*Disadvantage*: Harder to maintain overall consistency

** Choose Your Approach

*Fast drafters*: Multi-pass (more rounds, faster)
*Slow crafters*: Chapter-at-a-time (fewer rounds, thorough)
*Plotters*: Separate passes for plot/character/prose
*Pantsers*: All-in-one intensive revision

*Experiment to find what works for you!*

* Practical Exercise (20 Minutes)

Let's practice the revision workflow with a sample scene.

** Setup (2 minutes)

1. Open your manuscript
2. Find a scene you want to revise
3. ~F8 F8 e~ (activate editing mode)
4. In notes panel, create section for this scene

** Structural Check (3 minutes)

In notes panel, answer:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** Scene [X] - [Title]

Structural:
- Advances plot? Yes / No / How: __________
- Character development? Yes / No / How: __________
- New information revealed? Yes / No / What: __________
- Could be cut without loss? Yes / No
- Timeline consistent? Yes / No / Issue: __________
#+END_EXAMPLE

## Scene-Level Review (10 minutes)

Read the scene and check:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Opening:
- First line hooks reader? Yes / No
- Scene goal clear? Yes / No
- Fix: __________

Character:
- PoV consistent? Yes / No
- Voice distinct? Yes / No
- Motivation clear? Yes / No
- Fix: __________

Dialogue:
- Sounds natural? Yes / No
- Tags necessary? Yes / No
- Subtext present? Yes / No
- Fix: __________

Setting:
- Location clear? Yes / No
- Sensory details? (How many: _____)
- Fix: __________

Ending:
- Forward momentum? Yes / No
- Hook for next scene? Yes / No
- Fix: __________
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Make One Improvement (5 minutes)

Pick the biggest issue and fix it now:

*If opening is weak*:
- Rewrite first paragraph
- Add conflict/tension
- Cut throat-clearing

*If dialogue is flat*:
- Add subtext to one exchange
- Use ~F8 F8 y~ to improve dialogue tags
- Add action beats

*If setting is sparse*:
- Add 2-3 sensory details
- What does character smell/hear/feel?

** Mark Complete

In notes:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
- [X] Scene reviewed
- [X] Primary issue fixed
- Status: REVISED (ready for line editing later)
#+END_EXAMPLE

In manuscript, change TODO state:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
*** REVISED Scene [X] - [Title]
#+END_EXAMPLE

*You just completed one revision cycle!*

Repeat this process for every scene in your manuscript.
