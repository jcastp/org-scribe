** Sketches
*** opponents's point of view
# opponent as protagonist of his/her own story
** Phase 1: Flip the Script

*** The Core Exercise

Write your story from the antagonist's point of view as if THEY are the hero.

**** Instructions

1. *Forget* your protagonist exists for a moment
2. *Imagine* your antagonist is the hero of their own story
3. *Write* 500-1000 words from their POV showing:
   - What they want (their goal)
   - Why they want it (their motivation)
   - Why it's RIGHT (their justification)
   - What obstacles they face
   - Why they're willing to fight for it

**** Key Question

"If I told this story from the antagonist's perspective, would readers root for them?"

If NO → They're not competent/justified enough
If YES → You have a three-dimensional antagonist

*** Example: The Terrorist Leader

**** Weak Version (Villain)
"Victor wants to blow up the city because he's evil and hates people."
- Problem: No real motivation, just "evil"

**** Strong Version (Antagonist as Hero)
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Victor had watched the corporations poison his village's water for thirty years. His daughter died at seven from the cancer they caused. The government did nothing—they were bought. Peaceful protest changed nothing. 

Now he had the skills, the team, the plan. One explosion at the water company's headquarters during their shareholder meeting. The people responsible would finally pay. It wasn't murder—it was justice.

His team was loyal. They'd all lost someone to corporate greed. They called him terrorist. He called himself freedom fighter. History would decide who was right.

The only thing standing in his way was some government agent who'd never lost anyone, never seen what he'd seen. Someone who defended the system that killed his daughter.

He would not fail. Too many people depended on him. This was war, and in war, you did what was necessary.

- Could be the hero of a different story
