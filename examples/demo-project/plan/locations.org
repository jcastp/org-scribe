* The City
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: City
:NAME: Unnamed mid-sized city
:CLIMATE: Temperate, four seasons
:POPULATION: ~500,000
:END:

** General Description
A modern mid-sized city with a mix of old and new architecture. Urban but not
overwhelming. Has distinct neighborhoods with their own character. Public
transportation exists but most people drive. The kind of place where you can
find both chain coffee shops and local favorites.

** Geography

- Location :: East coast (implied but not specified)
- Terrain :: Relatively flat, some hills, near water
- Climate :: Four seasons, emphasis on crisp autumn mornings and harsh winter alarms
- Natural resources :: Parks, waterfront area

** Cultural Aspects

- Language :: English (American)
- Customs :: Contemporary American urban culture
- Government :: City council (not relevant to story)

** History
Not relevant to this story - contemporary setting.

** Importance in the Plot
The city itself is more of a backdrop. It's deliberately generic so readers can
project their own city onto it. The specific locations within the city (apartment,
coffee shop) are more important than the city as a whole.

* Alex's Apartment Building
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Apartment Building
:NAME: The building at corner of [Street Names TBD]
:FLOORS: 5
:BUILT: 1970s
:END:

** General Description
Older apartment building, well-maintained but not luxury. Mix of young
professionals and long-term residents. Sam lives in 4B, Alex in [TBD - 2A?].
Has a small lobby, elevator that's often slow, mailboxes in the entrance hall.

** Specific Places

*** Alex's Apartment (2A)
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Studio apartment
:END:

A small studio that's seen better organization. Creative chaos - art supplies,
design books, multiple coffee mugs in various states of use. Big window with
decent light (when Alex opens the curtains). Furniture is mismatched but
comfortable.

**** Layout
- Main room :: Combined living/sleeping/working area
- Kitchenette :: Along one wall, barely used beyond coffee maker
- Bathroom :: Small but functional
- Closet :: Overstuffed, source of the daily "what to wear" crisis

**** Key Features
- The Bed :: Scene of the snooze button battles
- The Desk :: Where Alex works, usually cluttered
- The Window :: Curtains usually closed, light barely gets in
- Coffee Table :: Where the watch is discovered under mail pile
- The Junk Drawer :: Source of the spare notebook

**** Atmosphere
Morning chaos. Afternoon creative energy. Evening exhaustion. By the end of the
story, it becomes more organized but retains personality.

**** Sensory Details
- Sight :: Dim (curtains closed), cluttered but colorful (art/design materials)
- Sound :: Traffic from street below, neighbor's TV through walls, alarm buzzing
- Smell :: Stale coffee, sometimes takeout
- Touch :: Rumpled sheets, smooth phone screen, worn carpet
- Emotional feel :: Initially claustrophobic, gradually becomes cozy

*** Sam's Apartment (4B)
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: One-bedroom apartment
:END:

Only seen briefly if at all in the story, but imagine it as organized, minimalist,
lots of light. Plants on the windowsill. Morning sun streams in.

Represents what Alex might aspire to, but ultimately Alex's place keeps its own
character - organized chaos rather than minimalism.

*** Building Lobby
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Common area
:END:

Where Alex and Sam might occasionally pass each other. Mailboxes, elevator,
bulletin board with community notices. Neutral space that facilitates their
neighborly relationship.

* Corner Coffee Shop
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Local coffee shop
:NAME: "Corner Coffee Shop" (generic, could have a name)
:ESTABLISHED: ~10 years ago
:END:

** General Description
Local independent coffee shop, not a chain. Cozy but busy in the mornings.
Counter up front, seating in back. Mix of regulars and commuters grabbing
coffee to go. The kind of place where baristas recognize regulars but there's
also always someone new.

** Layout
- Front :: Counter, register, pastry case, coffee equipment
- Back :: Small tables, a few comfortable chairs, corner booth
- Side wall :: Community board, outlet bar for laptops
- Window :: Front window with the shop name, looks out on street

** Atmosphere & Role in Story
This is where Alex and Sam's first real conversation happens. It's a transitional
space - between home and work, between night and day, between chaos and order.

The coffee shop represents routine for Sam (same time, same order every day) and
chaos for Alex (rushed, line too long, never the same time).

Later it becomes a neutral meeting ground where they talk. By the end, Alex
experiences it the way Sam does - as a peaceful morning ritual, not a stressful
rush.

** Sensory Details
- Sight :: Warm lighting, espresso machine gleaming, people in various states of awakeness
- Sound :: Espresso machine hissing, milk steaming, low conversation, music barely audible
- Smell :: Coffee beans, baked goods, slight burnt-sugar scent from caramel
- Touch :: Smooth counter, warm cup in hand, cool door handle
- Taste :: Quality coffee, better than what Alex makes at home

** Characters Associated
- Alex :: Initially rushed and stressed here
- Sam :: Regular, orders same thing, calm and collected
- Barista :: Minor character, efficient, knows Sam's order
- New Character :: Appears here in final scene, completing the circle

** Symbolic Meaning
The coffee shop is where change begins (first encounter with Sam) and where it
comes full circle (helping the new person). It's a threshold space.

* Other Locations (Brief/Mentioned)

** Alex's Workplace
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Home office
:END:
Alex works from home (freelance designer), so workplace = apartment. But they
might reference client meetings, which happen via video call or at clients'
offices.

** Sam's Workplace
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Office building
:END:
Tech company office, not described in detail. Just establishes that Sam has
a regular commute and office hours, contributing to his routine.

** The Park
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Public park
:END:
Mentioned as a possible location for expanded scenes. Could be where Sam goes
for morning walks, or where Alex might eventually try morning walks.

Could be useful for:
- Act II scene showing Alex trying Sam's routine
- Quiet reflection scene
- Different setting to break up apartment/coffee shop rotation

** The Waterfront
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Natural setting
:END:
Could be visible from certain parts of the city. Potential location for future
scenes. Represents openness, possibility.

* Setting Notes

** Time Period
Contemporary (2025). Technology exists (phones, apps) but isn't the focus.
Could be set any time in the last 5 years.

** Season
Story seems to take place over about 30 days. Could be:
- Late winter into early spring (cold mornings → warming)
- Early fall (back-to-school energy, new beginnings)

Either works. The changing season could parallel Alex's transformation.

** Weather
Not a major factor but could be used for:
- Harsh winter alarm making it harder to get up
- Spring light making mornings more appealing
- Rain as obstacle to morning walks
- Sunny morning as reward/motivation
