:DURATION: 30 minutes of snoozing
:CHARACTERS: Alex
:LOCATION: Alex's Apartment - Bedroom
:CHAPTER: Chapter 1, Scene 1
:END:

*** Description
Alex's alarm goes off at 6:30 but they hit snooze repeatedly (6:30, 6:45, 7:00). By the third alarm, panic sets in because they have an important meeting at 9:00 and are drastically behind schedule.

*** Consequences
- Establishes Alex's problematic relationship with mornings
- Sets up the day's chaos
- Creates sympathy for the character
- Demonstrates the ordinary world before change

:DATE: 2025-02-15
:TIME: 7:45 AM
:DURATION: ~5 minutes
:CHARACTERS: Alex, Sam
:LOCATION: Corner Coffee Shop
:CHAPTER: Chapter 1, Scene 2
:END:

*** Description
Alex rushes into the coffee shop, stressed and calculating minutes. Sam, standing in line behind them, gently comments on their rough morning and reveals they used to be the same way until they started a morning routine.

*** Consequences
- Inciting incident - plants seed of change
- Introduces Sam as mentor figure
- Establishes contrast between Alex's chaos and Sam's calm

:TIME: 9:00 AM
:DURATION: ~1 hour
:CHARACTERS: Alex, [clients/coworkers]
:LOCATION: [Video call or client office]
:CHAPTER: Mentioned in Chapter 2
:END:

*** Description
Alex makes it to the meeting on time but forgot their presentation notes. This is the culmination of the chaotic morning - barely avoiding total disaster but still suffering consequences of poor preparation.

*** Consequences
- Demonstrates real-world cost of morning chaos
- Motivates change (it's not just about being stressed, it affects work)
- Adds to the day's accumulated frustration
- Sets up evening decision

** Event 04: Finding the Watch
:PROPERTIES:
:DATE: 2025-02-15
:TIME: 8:30 PM
:DURATION: 15 minutes
:CHARACTERS: Alex
:LOCATION: Alex's Apartment - Living Room
:CHAPTER: Chapter 2, Scene 1
:END:

*** Description
While sitting on the couch with takeout, reflecting on the terrible day, Alex notices something glinting under the mail pile - their grandmother's watch. It's still ticking. This becomes the symbolic catalyst for change.

*** Consequences
- First plot point - decision to change
- Introduction of key symbolic object
- Emotional connection to grandmother's memory

- Alex writes "Day 1" in notebook

:CHARACTERS: Alex
:LOCATION: Alex's Apartment
:CHAPTER: Chapter 3, Scene 1
:END:

*** Description
Alex wakes at 6:00 without snoozing and attempts to follow a rigid routine: make bed, meditate 15 min, yoga, healthy breakfast, mindful shower. Everything takes longer than planned, meditation feels forced, and they end up exhausted and running late despite waking early.

*** Consequences
- Shows that change is difficult
- Demonstrates wrong approach (too rigid, not personalized)
- Alex feels discouraged but not defeated
- Sets up need for Sam's guidance

** Event 06: Coffee Talk with Sam

:DATE: 2025-02-19 (Day 5)
:TIME: 7:30 AM
:DURATION: 10 minutes
:CHARACTERS: Alex, Sam
:LOCATION: Corner Coffee Shop
:CHAPTER: Chapter 4, Scene 1
:END:

*** Description
Alex admits to Sam that they've been struggling with the routine. Sam shares the key wisdom: routines must be personalized, not perfect. They suggest Alex experiment to find what actually works for them, not what works for internet gurus.

*** Consequences
- Midpoint revelation
- Course correction in Alex's approach
- Deepens Alex-Sam relationship
- Provides hope and new direction
- Sam reveals they weren't always perfect either

:DURATION: 45 minutes
:CHARACTERS: Alex
:LOCATION: Alex's Apartment
:CHAPTER: Chapter 4, Scene 2
:END:

*** Description
Alex's personalized routine in action. They wake at 6:15 (not 6:00), skip meditation for music instead, do simple stretches, have coffee while journaling, and actually feel peaceful. The routine works because it's theirs.

*** Consequences
- Demonstrates successful change
- Shows flexibility over rigidity
- Character growth milestone
- Hope that sustainable change is possible

:CHARACTERS: Alex, Sam, Casey (new person)
:LOCATION: Corner Coffee Shop
:CHAPTER: Chapter 5, Scene 1
:END:

*** Description
Alex arrives at coffee shop calm and on time. A flustered person rushes in, clearly having a rough morning. Alex recognizes themselves in this stranger and offers the same kindness Sam showed them. Sam witnesses this moment. The cycle continues.

*** Consequences
- Climax and resolution
- Demonstrates complete character arc
- Alex has become someone who helps, not just someone who struggles
- Thematic payoff: kindness creates ripples
- Full circle structure (starts and ends in coffee shop)

* Backstory Timeline

** Grandmother's Death
:PROPERTIES:
:DATE: ~2023-02 (2 years before story)
:RELEVANCE: Major
:END:

Alex's grandmother Maria Rivera passed away two years before the story begins. She was a major influence in Alex's life, especially after their parents divorced. Her death left Alex feeling unmoored and contributed to the current state of disorganization.

The watch was her daily wear item. Finding it reconnects Alex to her memory and her wisdom about time, presence, and what matters.

** Parents' Divorce
:PROPERTIES:
:DATE: Alex's childhood (15-20 years ago)
:RELEVANCE: Minor
:END:

Mentioned briefly as contributing to Alex's difficulty with routine and stability. Moving between parents' houses created instability in childhood. Grandmother provided the one constant.

** Sam's Transformation
:PROPERTIES:
:DATE: ~2021 (4 years before story)
:RELEVANCE: Moderate
:END:

Sam went through their own quarter-life crisis and chaotic period. They discovered morning routines and initially went too rigid, then learned balance. This makes them an effective mentor - they've been there.

Not fully detailed in story but informs Sam's empathy and advice.

** Lost Client
:PROPERTIES:
:DATE: ~2024-08 (6 months before story)
:RELEVANCE: Minor
:END:

Alex lost a major client due to a missed deadline caused by morning chaos (overslept, forgot meeting). This was a wake-up call but not enough to create change on its own. Adds to accumulated frustration that makes Day 1 the tipping point.

* Timeline Notes

** Story Pacing
The 30-day span is condensed in the narrative:
- Day 1: Detailed (two full scenes)
- Day 2: One scene
- Days 3-4: Implied/skipped
- Day 5: One scene
- Days 6-7: Implied/skipped
- Day 8: One scene
- Days 9-29: Mostly skipped, possibly referenced in statistics
- Day 30: Final scene

This creates a sense of time passing while keeping narrative tight.

** Season
Late winter to early spring (February to March). Mornings are cold and dark at start, gradually getting lighter and warmer. This parallels Alex's internal transformation.

** Time of Day
Most scenes occur in the morning (6:00-8:00 AM) or early evening (8:00-9:00 PM). This focus on bookend times of day emphasizes the importance of morning routines and evening reflection.

** Real-Time vs Story-Time
The story covers 30 days but the narrative probably only represents about 3-4 hours of actual scene time. Much is summarized or implied. This is appropriate for the scope.
