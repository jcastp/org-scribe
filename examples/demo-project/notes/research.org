#+AUTHOR: Demo Author
#+STARTUP: overview

* Research Topics

** Morning Routine Science
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Psychology/Behavior
:PRIORITY: High
:STATUS: Completed
:END:

*** Questions to Answer
- How long does it take to form a habit?
- What makes routines sustainable vs. unsustainable?
- Why do people hit snooze?
- What's the psychology of morning people vs. night people?

*** Sources
- "Atomic Habits" by James Clear
- "The Power of Habit" by Charles Duhigg
- Various articles on habit formation (21 days is myth, 66 days average)
- Sleep science articles

*** Key Findings

**** Habit Formation Timeline
- Popular myth: 21 days
- Research shows: Average 66 days (range 18-254)
- 30 days is reasonable for story but acknowledge it's still forming
- Complexity matters: Simple habits form faster

**** What Makes Routines Stick
- Small, achievable steps
- Tied to existing habits (habit stacking)
- Personalized, not prescribed
- Flexible, not rigid
- Identity-based ("I'm someone who...")

**** The Snooze Button
- Actually makes you more tired (sleep inertia)
- Gives false sense of control
- Multiple snoozes = decision fatigue before day starts
- Breaking the habit: Alarm across room, immediate action

**** Chronotypes
- Morning people vs. night people is partly genetic
- But can be shifted somewhat with consistent routine
- Society favors morning people (work schedules)
- Alex isn't trying to become a morning person, just function better

*** How This Applies to Story
- Alex's 30-day transformation is realistic but still in progress
- Sam's advice should reflect actual research: personalize, start small, be flexible
- The snooze battle in Scene 1 is scientifically grounded
- Alex doesn't have to become a morning person to have a morning routine

** Freelance Designer Lifestyle
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Career/Work
:PRIORITY: Medium
:STATUS: Completed
:END:

*** Questions to Answer
- What's the daily life of a freelance graphic designer?
- How does working from home affect routine?
- What kind of schedule flexibility do they have?
- Common challenges?

*** Sources
- Interviews with freelance friends
- Articles on freelance life
- r/freelance and design subreddits

*** Key Findings

**** Typical Day
- No set hours = blessing and curse
- Clients in different time zones
- Deadline-driven work
- Mix of creative work and admin/communication
- Easy to work in pajamas (Alex definitely does this)

**** Challenges Relevant to Story
- No external structure (no commute, no office hours)
- Discipline is self-imposed
- Home/work boundary blurred
- Isolation
- Feast or famine cycles

**** Benefits for Story
- Explains why Alex has flexibility to experiment with routine
- Work-from-home means morning sets tone for whole day
- Client meetings create external accountability
- Creative work benefits from good mental state (routine helps)

*** How This Applies to Story
- Alex's job explains their flexibility but also their chaos
- Missing client deadline makes stakes real
- Working from home means morning routine directly affects work
- Not having to commute = one less external forcing function

** Coffee Shop Culture
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Setting/Atmosphere
:PRIORITY: Low
:STATUS: Basic research done
:END:

*** Questions to Answer
- What's a typical morning rush like?
- How do regulars interact with baristas?
- What's the vibe of independent vs. chain shops?

*** Sources
- Personal observation
- Working in coffee shops myself
- Conversations with baristas

*** Key Findings

**** Morning Rush Dynamics
- 7-9 AM busiest
- Mix of regulars (same time, same order) and one-offs
- Commuters (grab and go) vs. sitters (work on laptops)
- Baristas recognize faces even if not names
- Rhythm and flow, almost choreographed

**** Independent Shop Vibe
- More community feel than chains
- Bulletin board, local art, personality
- Regulars might nod to each other
- Slight premium on price
- Quality matters to customers

**** The Third Place Concept
- Not home, not work, but third space
- Neutral ground for connections
- Public privacy (alone together)
- Transitional space

*** How This Applies to Story
- Coffee shop is perfect setting for chance encounter
- Regular timing (Sam) vs. chaotic timing (Alex) visible here
- Neutral space for conversations
- Represents community, connection
- Transitional space literally (between home and work) and metaphorically (between old self and new)

** Grief and Objects
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Psychology/Emotion
:PRIORITY: Medium
:STATUS: Completed
:END:

*** Questions to Answer
- How do people relate to inherited objects?
- What makes something a meaningful keepsake?
- How long does acute grief last?
- When do people go through belongings after loss?

*** Sources
- Articles on grief and mourning
- Personal experience and observation
- "The Year of Magical Thinking" by Joan Didion

*** Key Findings

**** Timeline of Grief
- No set timeline
- 2 years (story timeline) is still processing
- Waves and triggers, not linear
- Objects can trigger memories

**** Inherited Objects
- Everyday items often more meaningful than "valuable" ones
- Items deceased wore/used regularly feel most connected
- Some people keep everything, some purge, most somewhere in between
- Sometimes can't face going through things immediately

**** Why a Watch Works
- Worn daily by grandmother = intimate object
- Functional = can be used, not just displayed
- Keeps time = literal connection to time passing
- Wearable = physical connection, kept close

*** How This Applies to Story
- 2 years since death = Alex still processing
- Watch in pile of stuff = too painful to deal with initially
- Finding it now = ready to reconnect
- Using it daily = honoring grandmother's memory
- Not making grief the focus but acknowledging it

** The 30-Day Challenge Concept
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: Self-Improvement Culture
:PRIORITY: Low
:STATUS: Basic understanding
:END:

*** Questions to Answer
- Why are 30-day challenges popular?
- Do they work?
- What's the psychology?

*** Sources
- Various 30-day challenge articles and apps
- Behavioral psychology

*** Key Findings
- 30 days feels achievable (vs. "forever")
- Month is natural time unit
- Creates artificial deadline/finish line
- Can work but only if followed by maintenance
- Alex's 30 days is beginning, not end

*** How This Applies to Story
- Story span of 30 days is psychologically meaningful
- But ending acknowledges this is ongoing, not "fixed"
- Alex hasn't "completed" growth, just started sustainable path

* Fact Checking

| Fact                                  | Source          | Verified | Notes                           |
|---------------------------------------+-----------------+----------+---------------------------------|
| Habit formation ~66 days average      | Research study  | Yes      | Using 30 days as "in progress"  |
| Sun rises ~7:00 AM in Feb (east coast)| Time and Date   | Yes      | Affects lighting in scenes      |
| Sleep inertia from snoozing           | Sleep science   | Yes      | Alex's groggy state accurate    |
| Freelancers work irregular hours      | Observation     | Yes      | Common experience               |
| Watch mechanisms can last decades     | Watch articles  | Yes      | Grandmother's watch plausible   |
| Coffee shops busiest 7-9 AM           | Observation     | Yes      | Setting timing accurate         |

* Research Still Needed

** None currently

All essential research completed. Any additional research would be:
- Deep dive into specific watch mechanisms (not necessary for story)
- More detail on graphic design tools (not story focus)
- Coffee roasting process (interesting but irrelevant)

Story has enough factual grounding to feel real while staying focused on character and theme.

* Research Notes for Revision

** Be careful with:
- Not making Alex's transformation seem too easy or fast
- Not being prescriptive about "the right way" to do mornings
- Acknowledging that what works for Sam doesn't automatically work for Alex
- Respecting that some people genuinely are night people

** Authenticity markers:
- Specific details about the work of habit formation (not just results)
- Alex's failures and struggles
- The meditation scene in Ch 3 - make it feel real, not mocking
- Coffee shop sensory details
- Freelance designer specifics (client calls, deadlines, software)

** Avoid:
- Pseudoscience (the "manifest your routine" type stuff)
- One-size-fits-all prescriptions
- Making it seem like routine solves all problems
- Toxic productivity culture messaging
