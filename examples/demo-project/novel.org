The harsh buzz of the alarm pierced through Alex's dream. Without opening
their eyes, one hand shot out from under the covers, fumbling across the
nightstand until fingers found the smooth surface of the phone. A practiced
swipe. Silence.

Five more minutes wouldn't hurt.

The room settled back into peaceful quiet, broken only by the soft hum of
traffic from the street below. Through the gap in the curtains, early morning
light painted a thin line across the ceiling. Alex pulled the blanket tighter,
burrowing deeper into the warmth.

The alarm buzzed again. This time, Alex cracked one eye open to glare at the
offending device. 6:45 AM. Still early enough. Another swipe.

When the third alarm went off at 7:00, panic finally cut through the fog of
sleep. Alex sat bolt upright, heart racing. The meeting. There was that
important meeting at 9:00, and they still needed to shower, find something to
wear, grab breakfast—

The familiar morning chaos had begun.

Alex burst through the coffee shop door at 7:47, already calculating minutes in
their head. Order coffee: two minutes. Wait for coffee: three minutes. Speed-walk
to the office: eight minutes. That left exactly zero minutes for anything to go
wrong.

The line was three people deep. Of course.

"Rough morning?" a friendly voice asked from behind.

Alex turned to find Sam, their neighbor from 4B, looking impossibly put-together
in a pressed shirt and actual smile. Sam always looked like they'd woken up at
a reasonable hour and had time for things like "breakfast" and "reading the news."

"Is it that obvious?" Alex asked, trying to smooth down their hastily-combed hair.

Sam's eyes crinkled with amusement. "I've learned to spot the signs. The
slightly-mismatched socks are a dead giveaway."

Alex glanced down. Navy blue and black. Close enough, they'd thought while
getting dressed in the dark bedroom to avoid turning on the harsh overhead light.

"You should try waking up earlier," Sam suggested, but their tone was gentle,
not judgmental. "I used to be exactly like you."

"You? Really?" Alex couldn't imagine it.

"Really. Then I started a morning routine. Changed everything." Sam pulled out
a small notebook from their bag—an actual paper notebook, not a phone app. "I
track it every day. Sounds rigid, but it's actually quite freeing."

Before Alex could respond, the barista called out Sam's order. Sam collected
their coffee with a nod, then turned back. "Think about it. See you around, Alex."

As Sam left, Alex noticed something—they'd been so caught up in the conversation,
they'd stopped mentally counting minutes. For just a moment, the morning chaos
had paused.

The day had been a blur of near-misses and minor disasters. Alex had made it to
the meeting on time but had forgotten their presentation notes. Lunch had been a
granola bar eaten at their desk. And coming home, they'd realized they'd worn
their shirt inside-out all day and no one had mentioned it.

Now, sitting on the couch with leftover takeout, Alex felt the weight of the day
settle on their shoulders. This couldn't keep being their life.

Sam's words echoed in their mind: "I used to be exactly like you."

Alex pulled out their phone to research morning routines but stopped when something
caught their eye—a glint of metal peeking out from under the mail pile on the coffee
table. They pushed aside the envelopes to reveal an old wristwatch, the one that had
belonged to their grandmother.

The watch was still ticking, somehow. Its face read 8:43 PM, and as Alex watched,
the second hand made its patient circuit. Steady. Reliable. Consistent.

Their grandmother had never been rushed, never been frazzled. She'd always had time
for what mattered—morning tea, evening walks, Sunday phone calls. She'd worn this
watch every day, and every day had seemed to have enough hours in it.

Alex fastened the watch around their wrist. The leather band was worn soft with age,
comfortable against their skin. They pulled out a notebook—a spare one from the junk
drawer, nothing fancy like Sam's, but it would do.

At the top of the first page, they wrote: "Day 1."

Tomorrow morning would be different.

The alarm went off at 6:00 AM sharp. This time, Alex didn't hit snooze. They'd
set the watch's alarm too, as backup, and the gentle ticking had somehow made it
easier to wake up.

They sat up immediately, trying to ignore how tired they felt. According to the
articles they'd read last night, the first step was to make the bed. Something
about starting the day with an accomplishment.

Alex pulled the covers up and smoothed them out. There. Accomplished.

Next on the list: meditation. They sat cross-legged on the newly-made bed and
closed their eyes. The app they'd downloaded said to "focus on your breath and
clear your mind."

Clear your mind. Sure. Easy.

Except their mind was already racing with thoughts: Did I set the coffee maker?
What am I going to wear? Should I have bought that expensive meditation app instead
of this free one? Is my breathing too loud? Am I doing this wrong?

After what felt like an hour but was probably three minutes, Alex gave up and
checked the watch. 6:12. The routine schedule said meditation should take fifteen
minutes, but they needed to move on or they'd fall behind.

The morning continued in fits and starts. Yoga stretches felt awkward without
proper instruction. The healthy breakfast recipe took twice as long as estimated.
The "mindful shower" just made them worry about the water bill.

By 7:30, Alex was exhausted and running late again—but this time, instead of just
chaos, there was also disappointment. They'd tried to do everything right, and it
still hadn't worked.

Alex walked into the coffee shop at 7:00 AM, right on schedule. Not because they
had to be, but because they wanted to be. The morning routine wasn't a rigid
checklist anymore—it was a gentle framework that made mornings feel like a gift
rather than a trial.

They'd learned to be flexible. Some mornings included meditation, some didn't.
Some mornings they woke at 6:00, some at 6:30. The watch on their wrist—
grandmother's watch, still ticking steadily—had taught them that time wasn't
about controlling every minute. It was about being present for the ones that
mattered.

There was no line today. Alex ordered their usual and stepped aside to wait,
pulling out the small notebook they now carried everywhere. Not to track every
detail obsessively, but to jot down thoughts, gratitudes, small moments worth
remembering.

The door burst open behind them, and Alex turned to see a young person rushing
in, hair disheveled, shirt slightly wrinkled, eyes wide with the particular
panic of running late.

Alex smiled, recognizing themselves from a month ago.

"Rough morning?" they asked gently.

The person looked startled, then embarrassed. "Is it that obvious?"

"I've learned to spot the signs," Alex said, Sam's words coming easily now.
"I used to be exactly like you."

As Alex shared their story—not preaching, just offering—they saw something shift
in the other person's expression. The same shift they'd felt that first morning
with Sam: a pause in the chaos, a moment of possibility.

When Sam walked in a few minutes later and saw Alex talking with the flustered
newcomer, they caught Alex's eye and smiled knowingly. Alex grinned back.

The morning light streaming through the coffee shop windows seemed a little
warmer, a little kinder. Alex glanced at the watch. 7:15. They had plenty of time.

They always did, now.
