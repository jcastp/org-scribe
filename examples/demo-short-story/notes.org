#+STARTUP: overview

* Characters

** Protagonist: Dr. Elena Chen
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Protagonist
:NAME: Dr. Elena Chen
:AGE: 34
:GENDER: Female
:END:

- Personality :: Brilliant, methodical, slightly obsessive about her work. Struggles with the weight of responsibility for her discoveries.
- Goal :: Successfully complete the quantum temporal communication experiment that could revolutionize physics.
- Conflict :: Must choose between trusting a message that claims to be from her future self or following through with the experiment that took years to plan.
- Key trait/quirk :: Always works alone at night when she needs to think deeply. Drinks earl grey tea obsessively.
- Background :: Child prodigy in physics, lost her mother to early-onset Alzheimer's. Driven by desire to "communicate across impossible distances"—metaphorically with her lost mother, literally through quantum mechanics.

** Supporting Character: Dr. Marcus Webb
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Supporting
:NAME: Dr. Marcus Webb
:END:

- Role :: Lab director, Elena's supervisor and mentor
- Relationship to protagonist :: Supportive but cautious. Doesn't know about Elena's private theories on backward causation.
- Key trait :: Risk-averse, prefers incremental progress over breakthrough risks

** Antagonist: The Paradox Itself
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Antagonist
:NAME: The Causal Loop
:END:

- Role :: The fundamental paradox of backward time communication
- What they want :: To preserve itself, to ensure its own existence
- Why they oppose protagonist :: Any attempt Elena makes to avoid the cascade ensures it happens; the paradox traps her in determinism

* Plot Outline

** Premise
What if you received a warning from your future self, but heeding that warning would create the very disaster you're trying to prevent?

** Setup
Elena is days away from testing quantum temporal communication. She's worked in secret on the backward causation aspects. The lab is quiet, she's alone, everything is ready.

** Inciting Incident
She receives an encrypted quantum message through her own system—from herself, 12 hours and 39 minutes in the future—warning her not to run tomorrow's test.

** Central Conflict
Should she trust the message and cancel the experiment, or is the message itself part of an elaborate hoax or hallucination from sleep deprivation?

The deeper conflict: If the message is real, then canceling the test creates a paradox (no test = no cascade = no warning = no cancellation = test happens anyway). If she ignores it and runs the test, she might cause exactly what the warning described.

** Climax
Elena runs the test. The cascade begins—a self-sustaining quantum field that starts unraveling the local spacetime. She has exactly 12 hours and 39 minutes before total collapse.

She realizes the message wasn't a warning to prevent the cascade. It was a necessary step to ensure the cascade happened exactly as it needed to. She must send the warning to complete the stable time loop.

** Resolution
Elena sends the message to her past self, completing the loop. She understands now that she never had a choice—the moment she received the message, her actions became fixed points in time. Free will was an illusion created by incomplete information.

The cascade stabilizes into a permanent quantum temporal field. She hasn't destroyed spacetime—she's created a bridge across it. But the cost is knowing she's trapped in a deterministic universe.

** Themes
- Determinism vs. free will
- The cost of knowledge
- Paradoxes as features, not bugs
- Grief and impossible communication
- The weight of being right

* Setting

** Main Location(s)
:PROPERTIES:
:LOCATION_NAME: CERN Quantum Research Laboratory
:TIME_PERIOD: 2047
:END:

- Description :: Underground research facility in Geneva. Sterile, clinical, but the quantum entanglement chamber has an otherworldly blue glow from the containment field.
- Important details :: The lab is always humming—a specific frequency that becomes comforting. At night, it's isolated, several floors underground, perfect for secret experiments.
- Atmosphere :: Initially scientific and calm, becomes claustrophobic as Elena realizes she's trapped in a predetermined sequence of events.

** Time Period
Near future—2047. Quantum computing is common, but quantum communication through time is still theoretical.

** World Rules
[For fantasy/sci-fi: what rules must stay consistent?]

- Magic/Technology :: Quantum entanglement allows instantaneous communication across space. Backward time communication is theoretically possible but requires massive energy and perfect field calibration. The "cascade" is a runaway quantum field effect that destabilizes local spacetime.
- Society/Culture :: Physics community is competitive but collaborative. CERN is still the premier research institution. Elena's work is cutting-edge enough that she keeps parts of it private.
- Limitations :: You cannot change the past, only complete it. Stable time loops are possible, but paradoxes resolve themselves through determinism. Free will might be an illusion in a universe with backward causation.

* Research & References

** Sources
- "The Quantum Thief" by Hannu Rajaniemi (for tone and quantum concepts)
- Novikov self-consistency principle (physics)
- Bootstrap paradoxes and stable time loops
- CERN research facility layout and protocols

** Facts to Remember
- Quantum entanglement doesn't actually allow faster-than-light communication in conventional physics
- The story handwaves this with "temporal entanglement" as a speculative extension
- The math doesn't have to be perfect, but the internal logic must be consistent

** Interesting Details
- The specific timestamp (12 hours 39 minutes) should be meaningful—it's how long the cascade takes to stabilize
- Elena's private encryption method is based on her mother's birthday
- The hum of the quantum chamber is 432 Hz, a frequency some believe has special properties

* Revision Notes

** Draft 1 - Issues to Address
- [X] Establish Elena's character and motivation in opening
- [ ] Make the middle section more tense—Elena's internal debate needs urgency
- [ ] The ending needs to be written! Aim for ~1500 words
- [ ] Add sensory details throughout—what does the lab smell like? Sound like?
- [ ] Clarify the science enough to be believable but not so much it becomes a lecture

** Beta Reader Feedback

*** Reader 1
Date: [Pending]
Comments:

*** Reader 2
Date: [Pending]
Comments:

** Changes Made
- Added more characterization for Elena in opening
- Included the earl grey tea detail
- Made the timestamp more specific and meaningful

* Random Ideas & Inspiration

** Potential Scenes
- Elena finding her mother's old research notes (maybe as a flashback?)
- A moment where she almost calls Marcus but decides against it
- The actual cascade beginning—visual spectacle

** Interesting Lines/Dialogue
- "Trust me. You have to trust yourself." (The core paradox of the message)
- "Some events in time aren't choices. They're inevitabilities."
- "The universe doesn't have plot holes. It has stable loops."

** Alternative Endings
1. Dark ending: The cascade doesn't stabilize, Elena dies knowing she caused it
2. Ambiguous ending: Did she really receive a message, or was it a hallucination?
3. Hopeful ending: The stable field allows her to communicate with her mother's past (too sentimental?)

** Style Notes
- Tone :: Scientific thriller with philosophical undertones. Clinical descriptions contrasted with Elena's emotional state.
- POV choice :: Third person limited, tight on Elena's perspective
- Tense :: Past tense
- Narrative distance :: Close third person—we're in her head but maintain some objectivity

** Words/Phrases to Avoid
- "Quantum" used too often (vary with "temporal field," "entanglement," etc.)
- Info dumps about the science
- Overwrought descriptions of the technology

* Writing Music/Atmosphere
- Playlist :: Ambient electronic (Aphex Twin's "Selected Ambient Works"), something with a steady hum
- Mood :: Late night, isolated, intellectual tension building to existential dread

* Similar Works for Reference
- Story/Book 1 :: "Story of Your Life" by Ted Chiang - What I like: The way it handles determinism and time. The emotional core beneath the science.
- Story/Book 2 :: "All You Zombies" by Robert Heinlein - What I want to avoid: Making the paradox too clever at the expense of character.
- Story/Book 3 :: "The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate" by Ted Chiang - Love how it treats time travel as inevitable, not changeable.
