*** What I worked on
Started the project! Wrote the opening scene with Alex and the chaotic alarm clock.
The scene flowed really well - I could really visualize Alex's messy bedroom and
the frustration of hitting snooze repeatedly.

*** Progress & Challenges
- Progress: Got Chapter 1, Scene 1 complete
- Challenge: Needed to research typical morning routines to make sure Alex's chaos
  felt realistic but not over-the-top

*** Next Session Goals
- [X] Finish Scene 2 (coffee shop)
- [X] Complete Chapter 1
- [ ] Start character development notes for Sam

*** What I worked on
Finished Chapter 1 with the coffee shop scene. Really enjoyed writing the
interaction between Alex and Sam - their dialogue feels natural and Sam's
calm demeanor makes a nice contrast.

*** Progress & Challenges
- Progress: Chapter 1 complete! Both scenes done.
- Challenge: Making Sam helpful without being preachy. Rewrote some dialogue
  to make it more subtle.

*** Next Session Goals
- [X] Write Chapter 2, Scene 1 (The Decision)
- [X] Introduce the grandmother's watch
- [X] Set up Act II

*** What I worked on
Morning session: Finished Chapter 2 with the watch introduction. Really happy
with how the watch became a symbol.

Evening session: Dove into Act II, Scene 1. Alex's first attempt at a routine.
Fun to write their internal monologue as they struggle with meditation.

*** Progress & Challenges
- Progress: Completed Chapter 2, started Act II, got Chapter 3 Scene 1 done
- Challenge: Balancing humor with genuine struggle. Don't want to mock people
  who meditate, but also want to show Alex's realistic difficulty with it.

*** Next Session Goals
- [ ] Continue Act II
- [ ] Write the mentor guidance scene with Sam
- [ ] Plan out Act III resolution

* Monthly Reviews

** Month 1 - January 2025

*** What went well
- Strong start with 2,847 words in first 3 days
- Character voices came naturally, especially the contrast between Alex and Sam
- The watch symbol emerged organically and feels meaningful

*** What was difficult
- Balancing humor with authenticity - don't want to make fun of people who
  struggle with routines or meditation
- Finding time for longer sessions (the two-session day on 01/17 worked great!)

*** Lessons learned
- Morning writing sessions produce different energy than evening ones
- Having a clear scene goal makes it easier to jump in and start writing
- The metadata properties are really helpful for tracking scene elements

*** Goals for next month
- Complete Act II (4 more chapters)
- Develop Sam's character more fully through their guidance scenes
- Maintain 500+ words per day average

* Writing Experiments

** Dual-session writing (morning + evening)
:PROPERTIES:
:DATE: 2025-01-17
:TECHNIQUE: Split daily writing into morning and evening sessions
:RESULT: Success - got 1,193 words and different perspectives
:END:

*** Description
Tried writing both in the morning (6-7am) and evening (8-10pm) on the same day.
Morning session for emotional/reflective scenes, evening for dialogue and action.

*** Outcome
Best word count day so far! Morning brain was great for the quiet watch scene.
Evening brain handled the meditation struggle scene well - needed more energy
for the humor.

*** Will I use this again?
Yes, when schedule allows. The variety in mental states actually helped with
different scene types.

* Breakthroughs & Insights

** 2025-01-16 - Sam's voice clicked
Finally figured out how to make Sam helpful without being preachy. The key was
making them ask questions rather than give advice. Much more natural and lets
Alex discover things.

** 2025-01-17 - The watch as symbol
The grandmother's watch evolved from a plot device into a real symbol of time
and presence. Excited to develop this throughout the story.

* Character Development Journey

** Alex
Started as a generic "chaotic person" but developing more nuance. They're not
lazy or careless - they genuinely struggle with executive function and routine.
Want to make sure this feels respectful and realistic.

** Sam
Initially too perfect. Adding more dimension by showing they also have struggles,
just different ones. They're helpful because they've been where Alex is, not
because they're naturally organized.

* Plot Evolution

The story was originally just about "learning to wake up early" but it's becoming
more about learning to be present and intentional. The morning routine is the
vehicle, not the destination. This feels more meaningful.

* Process Notes

** What's working for me
- Setting specific scene goals before each session
- Using the metadata properties to think through scene purpose before writing
- The org-tracktable for quick daily tracking
- Writing session notes immediately after finishing (while it's fresh)

** Productivity patterns
- Best time: Early morning (6-7am) or evening (8-10pm)
- Worst time: Mid-afternoon (too tired)
- Sweet spot: 60-90 minute sessions
- Need at least one rest day per week to let ideas percolate
