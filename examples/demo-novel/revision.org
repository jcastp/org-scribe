* Identified Problems

** Plot Problems
*** Act II pacing
Act II feels rushed. Alex goes from struggling to succeeding too quickly.
Need to add at least one more scene showing setback or continued struggle.

Possible addition: Scene where Alex tries to force Sam's exact routine and
it completely fails, leading to the realization that routines must be personal.

** Character Problems
*** Sam's perfection
Sam comes across as too perfect and wise. Need to humanize them more.

Ideas:
- Give them a struggle in another area of life
- Show them being wrong about something
- Have them admit their routine isn't always perfect

*** Alex's backstory
We know very little about Alex outside their morning struggles. Need to weave
in more details about their work, family, past.

** Style Problems
*** Sensory details
Coffee shop scenes need more sensory grounding - smells, sounds, textures.
Alex's apartment needs more visual detail.

*** Dialogue tags
Overusing "said" and "asked". Need more variety and action beats.

** Technical Problems
*** Timeline clarity
Make sure the 30-day progression is clear. Currently jumps from Day 1 to Day 2
to Day 5 to Day 8 to Day 30 - this works but should be explicit.

*** POV slips
One or two places where the narration seems to know things Alex doesn't.
Need to review for POV consistency.
