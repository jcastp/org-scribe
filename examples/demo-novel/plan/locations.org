:Importance: Supporting
:First-appearance: Chapter 1
:Climate: Temperate, four seasons
:Population: ~500,000
:END:

** General Description

A modern mid-sized city with a mix of old and new architecture. Urban but not overwhelming. Has distinct neighborhoods with their own character. Public transportation exists but most people drive. The kind of place where you can find both chain coffee shops and local favorites.

** Geography

- Location :: East coast (implied but not specified)
- Terrain :: Relatively flat, some hills, near water
- Climate :: Four seasons, emphasis on crisp autumn mornings and harsh winter alarms
- Natural resources :: Parks, waterfront area

** Cultural Aspects & Society

- Language :: English (American)
- Customs :: Contemporary American urban culture
- Religion :: Not relevant to story
- Government :: City council (not relevant to story)

** History

Not relevant to this story - contemporary setting.

** Notable Features

Generic mid-sized city features: mix of old and new buildings, public transit, distinct neighborhoods.

** Importance in the Plot

The city itself is more of a backdrop. It's deliberately generic so readers can project their own city onto it. The specific locations within the city (apartment, coffee shop) are more important than the city as a whole.

** Specific Places

Listed as separate location entries below: Alex's Apartment Building, Corner Coffee Shop, The Park, The Waterfront.

** Atmosphere & Mood

Contemporary urban life. Busy but not overwhelming. The kind of place where neighbors can become friends, where local coffee shops coexist with chains.

** Map/Reference Image

Not specified - intentionally left vague for reader interpretation.

** Notes

Setting is deliberately generic to allow readers to project their own city experiences onto the story.

:Type: Room
:Importance: Major
:First-appearance: Chapter 1, Scene 1
:Climate: Indoor
:Population: 1 resident
:END:

** Geography

- Location :: 2A in the apartment building

** Cultural Aspects & Society

** Specific Places

Main room (combined living/sleeping/working area), kitchenette, bathroom, closet.

** Atmosphere & Mood

**Morning**: Chaotic, dim (curtains closed), cluttered but colorful (art/design materials)
**Afternoon**: Creative energy
**Evening**: Exhaustion

**By story end**: More organized but retains personality - organized chaos rather than sterile minimalism.

**Sensory Details**:
- Sight :: Dim (curtains closed), cluttered but colorful (art/design materials)
- Sound :: Traffic from street below, neighbor's TV through walls, alarm buzzing
- Smell :: Stale coffee, sometimes takeout
- Touch :: Rumpled sheets, smooth phone screen, worn carpet
- Emotional feel :: Initially claustrophobic, gradually becomes cozy

** Notes

The apartment should evolve with Alex. Start messy, gradually become organized, but never lose its creative personality. This isn't about becoming minimalist - it's about functional organization that works for Alex.

** General Description

Local independent coffee shop (name TBD or keep generic "Corner Coffee Shop"). Not a chain. Cozy but busy in the mornings. Established about 10 years ago. Counter up front, seating in back.

- For Alex (finally) :: Peaceful morning ritual like Sam, but on their own terms

**Story Bookends**: First encounter with Sam happens here (Chapter 1). Final scene happens here (Chapter 5), where Alex helps Casey, completing the circle.

** Specific Places

Counter area, seating area, corner booth (possible location for Alex/Sam conversations).

Morning energy. Mix of people waking up and people already energized. Warm, inviting, smells amazing. Background music, espresso machine sounds, low conversation. Comfortable third place.

** Notes

The coffee shop represents routine for Sam and chaos for Alex, then eventually becomes a peaceful ritual for Alex too. It's where change begins and where it comes full circle. Symbolic threshold space.

* Setting Notes

** Time Period
Contemporary (2025). Technology exists (phones, apps) but isn't the focus. Could be set any time in the last 5 years.

** Season
Story seems to take place over about 30 days. Could be:
- Late winter into early spring (cold mornings → warming)
- Early fall (back-to-school energy, new beginnings)

Either works. The changing season could parallel Alex's transformation.

** Weather
Not a major factor but could be used for:
- Harsh winter alarm making it harder to get up
- Spring light making mornings more appealing
- Rain as obstacle to morning walks
- Sunny morning as reward/motivation
