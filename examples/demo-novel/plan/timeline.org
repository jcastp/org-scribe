#+TITLE: The Morning Routine - Timeline
#+AUTHOR: Demo Author
#+STARTUP: overview

* Timeline Overview

The story takes place over approximately 30 days in late winter/early spring (February-March 2025). The narrative doesn't show every day - it focuses on key moments in Alex's transformation.

** Story Pacing
The 30-day span is condensed in the narrative:
- Day 1: Detailed (two full scenes)
- Day 2: One scene
- Days 3-4: Implied/skipped
- Day 5: One scene
- Days 6-7: Implied/skipped
- Day 8: One scene
- Days 9-29: Mostly skipped, possibly referenced in statistics
- Day 30: Final scene

This creates a sense of time passing while keeping narrative tight.

** Season
Late winter to early spring (February to March). Mornings are cold and dark at start, gradually getting lighter and warmer. This parallels Alex's internal transformation.

** Time of Day
Most scenes occur in the morning (6:00-8:00 AM) or early evening (8:00-9:00 PM). This focus on bookend times of day emphasizes the importance of morning routines and evening reflection.

** Real-Time vs Story-Time
The story covers 30 days but the narrative probably only represents about 3-4 hours of actual scene time. Much is summarized or implied. This is appropriate for the scope.

:Chapter: Chapter 3, Scene 1
:END:

** Description

Alex wakes at 6:00 without snoozing and attempts to follow a rigid routine: make bed, meditate 15 min, yoga, healthy breakfast, mindful shower. Everything takes longer than planned, meditation feels forced, and they end up exhausted and running late despite waking early.

** Consequences

- Shows that change is difficult
- Demonstrates wrong approach (too rigid, not personalized)
- Alex feels discouraged but not defeated
- Sets up need for Sam's guidance

** Connections

** Description

Alex admits to Sam that they've been struggling with the routine. Sam shares the key wisdom: routines must be personalized, not perfect. They suggest Alex experiment to find what actually works for them, not what works for internet gurus.

** Consequences

- Midpoint revelation
- Course correction in Alex's approach
- Deepens Alex-Sam relationship
- Provides hope and new direction
- Sam reveals they weren't always perfect either

- Demonstrates complete character arc

** Description

Alex's grandmother Maria Rivera passed away two years before the story begins. She was a major influence in Alex's life, especially after their parents divorced. Her death left Alex feeling unmoored and contributed to the current state of disorganization.

** Consequences

- Contributes to current disorganized state
- Watch becomes hidden and forgotten

** Description

Mentioned briefly as contributing to Alex's difficulty with routine and stability. Moving between parents' houses created instability in childhood. Grandmother provided the one constant.

Sam went through their own quarter-life crisis and chaotic period. They discovered morning routines and initially went too rigid, then learned balance. This makes them an effective mentor - they've been there.

** Consequences

- Creates his routine tracking system
- Learns the lesson about flexibility vs rigidity
- Positions him to help Alex effectively

:Chapter: Referenced
:END:

** Description

Alex lost a major client due to a missed deadline caused by morning chaos (overslept, forgot meeting). This was a wake-up call but not enough to create change on its own. Adds to accumulated frustration that makes Day 1 the tipping point.

** Consequences

- Financial impact
- Professional embarrassment
- Wake-up call (but not enough alone)
- Adds to frustration that builds to Day 1

** Connections

- Links to: The Alarm Goes Off, Important Meeting

** Notes

Referenced briefly. Shows this is a pattern, not a one-time problem. Day 1 is the final straw, not the first warning.
