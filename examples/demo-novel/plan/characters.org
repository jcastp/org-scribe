* Secondary Characters

** Sam Chen
:PROPERTIES:

:NAME: Sam Chen

:END:

*** Description
Asian-American, 5'10", slim build, always looks put-together. Wears glasses, has neat short hair, calm demeanor. Works in tech (project manager). Gives off an air of quiet confidence.

*** Personality
- Patient, organized, genuine, non-judgmental
- Strength: Emotional intelligence, consistency
- Weakness: Can be too rigid sometimes, struggles with spontaneity
- NOTE: Need to develop this more per beta reader feedback - give him a flaw!

*** Role in the Story
The mentor figure who shows Alex that change is possible. Provides guidance without being preachy. Represents what Alex could become, but importantly, isn't perfect himself.

*** Relationship with Protagonist
Neighborly acquaintance → mentor → friend. Sam sees potential in Alex and remembers his own struggles. Genuinely wants to help, not just prove how great his system is.

*** Development Note
BETA READER FEEDBACK: Sam feels too perfect. Need to:
- Show him struggling with something (spontaneity? relationships? work stress?)
- Have him admit his routine isn't always perfect
- Maybe show a moment where his advice doesn't work for Alex
- Give him personal stakes beyond just helping Alex

*** Possible backstory
Went through a quarter-life crisis himself 4 years ago. Used to be chaotic like Alex. Overcompensated with extreme routines. Now trying to find balance too.

** The New Character (Chapter 5)
:PROPERTIES:
:TYPE: Minor
:NAME: Casey (tentative)
:ROLE: Symbol of cycle continuing
:END:

*** Description
Young person (early 20s) clearly having a terrible morning. Reminds Alex of themselves at the beginning.

*** Role in the Story
Appears only in final scene. Gives Alex the chance to pay forward Sam's kindness. Shows that Alex has truly changed - they now notice and help others instead of being consumed by their own chaos.

*** Relationship with Protagonist
Complete stranger who Alex helps, mirroring the Sam/Alex first meeting.
