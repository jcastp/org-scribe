#+TITLE: The Morning Routine - General Notes
#+AUTHOR: Demo Author
#+STARTUP: overview

* Random Ideas

** Potential Scenes

*** Coffee shop busy morning
During peak morning rush hour, showing contrast between different people's
morning states. Some calm, some rushed. Could illustrate that everyone has
different relationships with mornings.

Status: Might use for Act II expansion

*** Alex's work crisis
A scene showing how morning chaos affects the rest of the day. Client video
call where Alex is frazzled. Could make the stakes more concrete.

Status: Consider for revision

*** Sam's vulnerability moment
IMPORTANT: Beta readers said Sam feels too perfect. Need a scene where Sam
admits they struggle with something or that their routine isn't always perfect.

Ideas:
- Sam mentions they've been terrible at evening routines
- Sam admits they sometimes skip their routine and feel off
- Sam shares a moment when routine failed them (travel, emergency, etc.)

Status: PRIORITY for next draft

*** The watch stops
Dramatic idea: what if the watch stops at some point? Alex panics but then
realizes they've internalized the routine and don't need the external symbol
anymore?

Status: Maybe too heavy-handed. Could work if subtle.

** Interesting Dialogues

*** Alex to themselves (internal monologue)
"Five more minutes wouldn't hurt." - Repeated lie Alex tells themselves

"Close enough." - About the socks, about life, about everything

"Tomorrow. I'll start tomorrow." - The eternal procrastination

*** Sam's wisdom
"I used to be exactly like you." - KEY LINE, establishes connection

"It's not about perfection, it's about showing up." - Philosophy

"Your routine should fit your life, not the other way around." - Main lesson

*** Casey (new person) in final scene
Possibilities:
"Is it that obvious?" - Mirrors Alex's line from Scene 2
"I'm always like this." - What Alex used to believe
"I don't think I'm a morning person." - Common excuse

** Descriptions

*** The coffee shop morning light
Golden early light streaming through front window, catching dust motes and
steam from espresso machine. Creates that early morning cathedral feeling.

*** Alex's apartment transformation
Don't make it too dramatic, but subtle signs of change:
- Curtains actually open
- Bed made (but not military-perfect)
- Coffee table cleared (watch was under mail, now on wrist, mail dealt with)
- Morning light on the walls

*** The watch catching light
When Alex looks at it - catch the light, glint of silver, reminder of
grandmother. Don't overdo but use occasionally for emotional beat.

* Problems to Solve

** Detected Plot Holes

*** FIXED: Timeline clarity
Originally wasn't clear that days were passing. Fixed by being explicit:
"Day 2," "Day 5," etc.

*** TODO: The important meeting
In Chapter 1, Scene 2, Alex mentions the 9:00 meeting. But we never see what
happens. Should either:
a) Show it briefly in Chapter 2 flashback
b) Make the consequences clearer
c) Cut the mention entirely

Currently: Left vague but mentioned in reflection. Decide if this works.

*** TODO: Where does Sam work?
If Sam's leaving for work at 7:30/8:00, what kind of job and where? Need
consistency. Current plan: tech company, project manager, office about 20
minutes away.

** Inconsistencies

*** Alex's apartment number
First draft said 2A, make sure this is consistent throughout. Sam is 4B.

*** Coffee shop name
Kept it generic as "Corner Coffee Shop" but should decide if it has a real
name or if generic is the point (could represent any coffee shop).

Decision: Keep generic for universality.

*** Time zones/sunrise
If setting is east coast in February, sun rises ~7:00 AM. When does it get
light? Make sure 6:30 AM scenes have appropriate light levels.

** Unanswered Questions

*** What's Alex's exact freelance specialty?
Graphic design, but what kind? Web? Print? Branding? Illustration?

Current answer: Branding and web design. Enough to explain flexible schedule.

*** Does Alex have friends besides Sam?
Probably, but they're not relevant to this particular story. Could mention in
passing to make Alex's life feel fuller.

*** What happened to grandmother's watch between death and discovery?
Assume: It was in a box of grandmother's things, Alex couldn't bear to go
through them right after the death, box got absorbed into apartment chaos,
watch eventually ended up in misc. stuff on coffee table.

* Creative Decisions

** Point of View

- Narrator :: Third person limited (Alex's POV only)
- Tense :: Past tense
- Distance :: Close third - we're in Alex's head, experiencing their thoughts

Why: Allows for internal monologue and irony (Alex's perception vs. reality) while maintaining slight distance for perspective.

** Tone

- Overall :: Gentle, hopeful, slightly humorous
- Not :: Preachy, judgmental, sarcastic, dark
- Balance :: Acknowledge real struggle but maintain hope
- Humor :: Self-deprecating but not mean, observational

Goal: Reader should feel encouraged, not lectured. "I could do this too."

** Style

- Sentences :: Mix of short and long, rhythm matters
- Paragraphs :: Shorter for readability, white space
- Dialogue :: Natural, not too polished, people interrupt themselves
- Description :: Sensory, specific, but not purple prose
- Pace :: Contemplative but not slow, moves forward

** Verb choices
Active voice primarily. Present-tense verbs in past-tense narration for
immediacy: "The alarm buzzes" vs "The alarm buzzed."

* Words/Phrases to Avoid

List of filler words or words I use too much:

- "just" - Filler word, weakens sentences
- "really" - Another filler, rarely needed
- "very" - Replace with stronger single word
- "rushed/rushing" - Using this too much to describe Alex
- "chaotic/chaos" - Good but varying the language
- "somehow" - Vague, be more specific

Alternatives to explore:
- Instead of "rushed" - hurried, raced, flew, dashed, scrambled
- Instead of "chaotic" - disorganized, scattered, frenzied, tumultuous

* World Rules

Not fantasy/sci-fi, but still have consistency rules:

** Contemporary realism
- Real world, current time (2025)
- No magical solutions - change comes from character work
- Technology exists but isn't the focus
- Realistic timeframes for habit change (~30 days is reasonable)

** Emotional realism
- Change is hard
- Progress isn't linear
- People are complex
- Routines help but aren't magic
- Balance over perfection

** The watch
It's symbolic but NOT magical. It doesn't make Alex wake up easier. It's just
a reminder and a connection. The change comes from Alex's choices.
